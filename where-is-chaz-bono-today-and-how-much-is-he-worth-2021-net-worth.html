While the star is known for his on-screen roles, he is best known for being the son of none other than the pop icon herself, Cher.</p><p>Although being tied to Cher hasn't always been fun, it's certainly catapulted Bono to great success. The star has landed an array of TV roles including The Bold & The Beautiful. However, Bono first <a href=#>got his start in TV when he joined his mom and dad</a>, Sonny Bono on The Sonny And Cher Show.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52495242.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Cher "Only" Averaged $6 Million Per Year Throughout Her Career, But It All Adds Up</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Cher might be worth hundreds of millions of dollars today, but it's been a long time coming.</span><p>In 2008, Bono made national headlines when he revealed that he was transgender, unfortunately <a href=#>losing some fans in the process</a>. Bono, who was born Chastity, transitioned between 2008 to 2010, later sharing his process in the 2011 film, Becoming Chaz. While he's remained in the spotlight, many fans are curious what Bono has been up to since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated October 2023: </strong>Chaz Bono has had quite a life to date. From being the only child of Cher and Sonny Bono and being in the spotlight essentially since birth, Bono has known nothing other than life in the spotlight.</p><p>After Bono made the decision to come out as transgendered in 2008, his life changed completely. Before this, he had made the decision to do something other than act because taking on women's roles was not what he wanted. After his transition, Bono returned to acting and has had a fairly successful career since that time.</p><p>Bono also continues to be a voice for the LGBTQ+ community, with Cher standing by his side, giving her full support.</p><p>As for his love life, it was rocky for a bit but that all changed when Bono met Shara Blue Mathes. The two have been in a committed relationship nearly since they met and just recently celebrated their anniversary together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-is-chaz-bono-today>Where Is Chaz Bono Today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar47774964-1.jpg><p>Chaz Bono is no stranger to the spotlight! Following his time appearing alongside his famous parents, Cher and Sonny Bono, back in the 1970s, the star has since remained in the industry as an actor, singer, and LGBTQ+ activist. In 2008, Bono revealed that he would be transitioning, sharing with the world that he was, in fact, transgender.</p><p>Since then Bono has stood as a beacon of light for the trans community and has worked closely with GLAAD, The Trevor Project, and Straight But Not Narrow, to name a few. While his charitable work has certainly had a major impact, Bono has also been vocal about politics, mainly when it came to the 2020 Presidential Election. Cher also joined in on the action, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">raising over $2 million</a> for Joe Biden in a virtual LGBTQ+ fundraiser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily for Bono, his efforts were by no means wasted following the Biden/Harris win. With so much of his views and values stemming from his experience as a trans male, it's evident that Bono isn't afraid to speak out. Although his charitable work has had a major impact, Bono has always been an entertainer!</p><p>Bono landed the role of Reverend Rydale in The Bold & The Beautiful back in 2016, the same year he landed a spot on Ryan Murphy's hit series, American Horror Story. Chaz appeared in 13 episodes between 2016 and 2017, where he took on the role of Gary K. Longstreet.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Are-Emma-Roberts-And-Evan-Peters-Still-Friends-With-The-Cast-Of-American-Horror-Story_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>'American Horror Story': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Many of American Horror Story's cast has appeared in multiple seasons, each growing their net worth.</span><p>In 2019, Chaz landed a role on Famous & Fatal, that is before the pandemic put a pause on the actor's career.</p><p>But once the pandemic ended and Hollywood went back to work, Bono did as well. He appeared in The Guardians of Justice (Will Save You!) and Bury the Bride.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bono also has four projects in various stages of production that will be coming out in 2024 and perhaps, 2025 as well.</p><h2 id=who-is-chaz-bono-in-a-relationship-with>Who Is Chaz Bono In A Relationship With?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar44470179-1.jpg><p>Luckily for Bono, his career wasn't the only thing doing well. The star <a href=#>began dating his girlfriend, Shara Blue Mathes back in 2017</a>, and the two have been inseparable ever since! Bono and Mathes met through mutual friends and bonded over their similar upbringings in Hollywood.</p><p>Mathes, much like Bono, is also an actress and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began acting at a young age</a> when she first appeared in Jason Bateman's 1984 series, It's Your Move.</p><p>The two recently celebrated their six-year anniversary together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chaz-bono-39-s-net-worth>Chaz Bono's Net Worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar51313055-2.jpg><p>While Bono has acted in several projects, his career did not really start picking up until the last several years. As such, he has a net worth of $800,000.</p><p>However, not only does Bono have four projects that are waiting to be released as soon as the SAG-AFTRA strike ends and Hollywood can get back to work, it appears that he is working on projects of his own, as can be seen via Instagram. As such, it would not be surprising as a result of more exposure if Bono does not increase his net worth in the next several years.</p><p>Sources: IMDb, CelebrityNetWorth</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqqv4ycn5qyXZe8r7uMraadmalirq%2BwjKGmsGWdqrCpecisZKGdXay8s8DHZmlpamFiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
