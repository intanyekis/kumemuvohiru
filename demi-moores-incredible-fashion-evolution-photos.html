While her more recent appearances have been marked by skin-baring ensembles and sleek, monochromatic looks, she’s had quite the fashion evolution during her three decade-long career. 
On her way to developing her chic-meets-sexy aesthetic, the Striptease star has taken many haircuts and styles for a test run, played with prints and patterns and experimented with every silhouette imaginable."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With tight curls that were trendy at the time and a bold red lip, her glam for the evening couldn’t have been a bigger departure from her present day straight and sleek glass hair.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for the fashion? She wore a mermaid-style lilac dress complete with a lace bodice. She went so far as to pair the dress with matching gloves.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>By the time the early 2000s rolled around, Moore had clearly developed a recognizable style, opting for classic black dresses and pant suits that either were made with panels of sheer fabric, had plunging necklines or showed off her decolletage.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While timeless options remain her go-to, the Indecent Proposal star has started to throw a bit of funky fashion into the mix. At the 2016 LACMA Film + Art Gala for example, she stunned in a Gucci dress that featured embroidered roses along the neckline and bright red puff shoulders.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The following year, she took a page out of the same playbook, wearing a fabulous floral-print Gucci suit with pops of pink and green to the Blind premiere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Moore can certainly rock a designer outfit on the red carpet, but in January, she proved that she looks just as good on the runway. For the Fendi Spring/Summer 2021 fashion show, the star walked alongside models like <a href=#><strong>Bella Hadid</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Cara&nbsp;</strong><b>Delevingne</b></a>.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“First of all, truly, it didn’t hit me until afterwards that it really was like a teenage fantasy fulfilled,” she said on<a href=#><strong> Naomi Campbell</strong></a>’s YouTube series No Filter With Naomi. “I took a moment where I thought, ‘Oh my God! I literally just walked a runway show with some of the biggest models ever.’ For me, I literally felt like a little kid.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>To see how Moore went from a fresh face in Hollywood to a red carpet regular and ~ occasional ~ runway model, keep scrolling!&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvDnqSiZZ2kvLOx0magp5uimrGqrsueZJ%2BZo522sLqMnq2opKWptrC6jKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
