And to come back in five to six months or four to five months — whatever that time frame was — I just thought, ‘You know what? It’s time to really write a new chapter.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kristian-Alfonso-Days-of-Our-Lives-Exit-offer.jpg><p>Alfonso doubled down on her decision too. “I <a href=#>don’t plan on returning and popping in as others have done</a> in the past,” she noted. “I think that chapter is closed and a new one needs to be started.”</p><p>She added: “It’s been a roller coaster of emotions. I have no regrets.”</p><p>Alfonso announced her departure earlier this month. “<a href=#>Days of Our Lives</a>&nbsp;has been a vital part of both my personal and professional journey,” she said in a July 6 statement on Instagram. “I am forever grateful to NBC and the late [producer] Betty Corday, who took a chance on me many years ago and changed my life.”</p><p>The Daytime Emmy winner went on to thank the cast and crew. “I have built some lifelong friendships with my extraordinarily talented castmates.&nbsp;Days&nbsp;has one of the hardest working crews in all of television, many of whom have become part of my extended family,” she continued. “I feel blessed and honored to have been invited into people’s homes for over three decades.”</p><p>She concluded by expressing gratitude to her fans: “I could not have done it without YOU!!!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Alfonso filmed her final scenes as Hope prior to&nbsp;<a href=#>Days of Our Lives’ production shutdown</a> in March. Her last episode is set to air in October.</p><p>The Massachusetts native joined the soap in 1983, taking two brief breaks in 1987 and 1990.
