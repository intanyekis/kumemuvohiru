David is a songwriter/ singer by profession who is famous for his contribution to music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did David Crosby die?</h2><p>The founding member of the band Stills & Nash, David Crosby, has died at the age of 81.</p><p>His wife announced the death in a statement made on Thursday, 19th Jan. She said, <strong>“It is with great sadness after a long illness, that our beloved David Crosby has passed away.”</strong></p><p>According to David’s wife, Jan Dance, the cause of death was a prolonged illness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did David Crosby and Jan Dance meet?</h2><p>The two of them met when Jan was working as a receptionist in the <a href=#>entertainment</a> industry. The bond strengthened because they both shared the same interests, i.e., music.&nbsp;</p><p>After spending a few months together, David married Jan Dance at a Hollywood church in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=6.5><p>An autobiography by David Crosby stated,<strong> “In Florida, I had the opportunity to meet Jan Dance, which turned out to be one of the smartest things I ever did. She was an incredibly energetic, funny, bright, smiley human being, and I fell in love with her. I fall in love with her probably two, three times a day nowadays.”</strong></p></figure><p>Around two hundred people attended David’s wedding, including a couple of big names like Howard Hessman, Joe Walsh, and Stephen Stills.</p><p>What impressed Jan initially was the type of music that David composed. But she didn’t ever think of them being together since David was dating at the time they met.</p><p>Dan said in an interview that she was confused about her feelings regarding David because he was dating at the time they met. Dan believed that it was not appropriate to chase after a person who was already dating.</p><p>In the 36-year marriage, the couple gave birth to one son, who is now 27 years old with the name Django. According to IMDB, David’s son has worked with him in the documentary David Crosby: Remember My Name.</p><p>David Crosby was also the father of Erika Keller Crosby, James Raymond, and Donovan Crosby, but not in the same marriage. For 30 years of Ramond’s life, David Crosby was unaware that he was the child’s father.&nbsp;</p><p>Raymond’s mother left her son for adoption, and Raymond’s adoptive parents encouraged him to search for his biological father.</p><p>Raymond had worked as a musician for twenty years of his life. Crosby declared that music was in his genes, making his son follow the same path.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwwK%2BgnWWTp7y0rthmrqKelWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
