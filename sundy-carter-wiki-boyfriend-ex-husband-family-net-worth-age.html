Unfortunately, her boyfriend, Larry didn’t admit to taking responsibility for the unborn baby. Carter also supposedly dated&nbsp;<strong>Miles Brock</strong> in the year 2016, but this turned out to be fallacious.</p><p>As of now, Sundy Carter is single and seems to be relishing her life the way it is going.
