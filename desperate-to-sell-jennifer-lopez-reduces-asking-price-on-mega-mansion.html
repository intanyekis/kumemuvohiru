The couple <a href=#>bought a Bel-Air mansion for $65 million</a> earlier this year after months of house hunting. Ben and Jen’s new pad sits on 1.1 acres of land and features 10 bedrooms, 17 bathrooms, and 4 kitchens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like his wife, Ben is also trying to offload once of his properties.

This includes the Georgia compound where the couple celebrated their wedding last year.</p><p>Ben originally bought the Georgia estate in 2003 for $7.5 million. It features 87-acres of land, which includes over 13,000 square feet of living space.

However, many of the comments expressed surprise Jen chose to come out with an alcohol line, considering she’s said in the past she doesn’t drink and that her husband has openly admitted to having struggles with alcohol.
