Some of the earliest Pokémon cards have skyrocketed in value over the past 2 years and the 25-year-old has become an avid collector. The YouTuber has spent over $5 million amassing a collection of increasingly rare first-edition boxes.
The Youtuber took to Twitter to reveal the sealed packs in a photo. In a later video detailing the purchase a friend could be heard saying that he believed the collection was currently the only one known to exist."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That is a three and a half million dollar box. We are sitting in the vicinity of a 11 First Edition Base Set Pokémon boxes. This will probably never happen again. Is this the only one that we know that exists? ... How many first edition Charizards are inside here? I can hear them. They are trying to get out, bro," said Paul.</p><p>Paul didn’t reveal his plans for the cards, but it’s a safe bet that he won’t keep the cards&nbsp;sealed. His live streaming events featuring rare set reveals have become incredibly popular.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=#>Suit Up: 10 Most Expensive Celebrity Suits Ever Sold At Auctions</a></p><p>The social media personality also seemed eager to find out how many valuable cards&nbsp;he might now possess.</p><p>The up-and-coming boxer was the focus of a lot of attention when he showed up at the Hard Rock Stadium&nbsp;donning a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diamond-encrusted chain bearing a Charizard card</a> to fight&nbsp;<a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a>. Paul claims the card is worth $1 million, and his claims&nbsp;might not be far-fetched considering its rarity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This is a Pokemon card. It’s a BGS 10 Charizard, first edition Charizard. It’s one of three in the world. It is my prized possession," Paul said. “This is a million-dollar card, baby. This is the card I walked out with to the Floyd Mayweather fight. This is a million-dollar card.”</p><p>This isn't the first time the Youtuber has splurged on rare cards. Earlier this year Paul dropped $2 million on 6&nbsp;unopened boxes of first edition cards. He decided to auction off a single&nbsp;box containing 36 packs for $10,000 each. Ultimately, the packs sold for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an average of $39,206 each</a>, and Paul netted a substantial profit.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Billionaire Harry Macklowe And Wife Linda Auction Their $676 Million Art Collection Post Divorce</a></span></p><p>Source: ComicBook,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Business</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5sLPAp2SpmaWherS8xKebrGVjYoJuucilo6KnnmK8r3nPqKKepZ%2BjeqSt0Z2qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
