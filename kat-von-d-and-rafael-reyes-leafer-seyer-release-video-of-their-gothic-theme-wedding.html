The couple secretly got married in the month of February but that did not stop them from throwing their cash on a lavish yet extraordinary wedding celebration. Staying true to their personalities, the pair decided to incorporate their persona into their gothic theme wedding. Kat and Rafael followed through with the theme on the invitations as well. Designed in the shape of a skull with gold calligraphy text written on the back of it, the invitations were nicely packed in a black box. It is reported that Kat did her own calligraphy.&nbsp;</p><p>The theme of the day according to what is embossed on her wedding invitations, seems to be "en vida y en muerte," or "in life and in death." The color of the day was bold bright red which was reflected right down to her dress. The gown was custom-designed by Adolfo Sanchez. The pair released a video to let their fans have a tour of what it looked like on their wedding day.&nbsp;</p><p>The video&nbsp;begins with Rafael explaining what marrying Kat meant for him. "Thanks to her I am seeing life through a different lens&nbsp;and everything is so much brighter," he says. I owe her my life. I had no idea that I was dying inside." Even Kat opened up about her feelings for Rafael. "He is the most kind, intellectual, beautiful person I have ever met," she said. "Some days I wake up and think I don't deserve this. I have never been loved the way he loves me. So, there is absolutely no way in hell that I will ever let this go and I look forward to marrying the hell out of him a million times forward."</p><p>The two also shared a series of pictures they had taken for the wedding in the video. For everyone who knew Kat, it wasn't a surprise that she chose to wear red for her wedding. The tattoo artist hinted that her wedding would be anything but white.&nbsp;Her wedding gown also included a romantic cathedral train, a mind-blowing veil, and ruffles. The interior of the ceremony was just the cherry on top of the cake for their wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>With a dark ambiance and lights that looked like candles floating in the air, it was a picture that everyone would remember. The two stood in the middle of the ceremony and said their vows while on a pedestal which was covered with red cloth, fitting perfectly with the theme. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kat</a> also sat down and performed a song at their wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding</a>, Kat even shared a close-up photo of three scarlet carnations tied together with a velvet ribbon and wrote a very touching and heartfelt caption.&nbsp;"Such a beautifully emotional day today. Tomorrow, @prayers and I will have our wedding ceremony for our close friends + family. This has been the sweetest, most stress-free experience where we continuously [sic] fell in love with each other all over again with each day counting down," she wrote.&nbsp;"This is a photo of 3 carnations that our dear friends @majestyblack brought us tonight after our rehearsal and soundcheck. Red carnations are @prayers favorite flower, and the 3 represent him, me, and our sweet baby boy we are adding to our family. All I can say right now is that I am so grateful for my dear friends, and for my sweet husband.
