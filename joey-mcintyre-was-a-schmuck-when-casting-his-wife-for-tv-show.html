I went back and forth … which is weird, because first of all you’re asking your wife to really help you out and then you’re like, “Well, I’m not so sure.” I was a schmuck there for a while. I was just trying to … keep my producer hat on and make sure I was doing what was right for the show. She was great. The more we went along with the series I just realized how good she is.</p><h3>What was your kids’ reaction to being on TV?</h3><p>They loved it. My daughter seems like a natural in that she’s got a dry sense of humor. My youngest son, Rhys, was a director’s dream because he would hit his mark every time, it was amazing. And then my oldest son, he’s a little bit more of a showman. Everybody had their [screen time], but my wife of course was like, “It better be even.”</p><h3>Do you feel, like your character, that people won’t take you seriously as an actor because of your boy-band past?</h3><p>Not really; I had to get over it to play it because if this was still a problem I don’t think I would be able to freely put my ego aside and … be the butt of the joke. There have been times in my career when I’ve felt that way … [But] over the last few years I’ve focused on my acting career a little bit more and I’ve had great opportunities, so I was in a good place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/joey_nkotb1a.jpg><h3>What’s it like to still be performing with New Kids 30 years after you first joined?</h3><p>Crazy. We took a lot of time off, but we’ve been together this time now longer than the first time. It’s a ton of fun. We take it seriously but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We know how lucky we are to be playing arenas and doing what we love to do. It’s the gift that keeps on giving.</p><h3>What’s the fan reaction these days when you walk down the street?</h3><p>It’s not 1990. But it seems like every time I need a fan to be somewhere, they are — whether it’s getting a nice table in a restaurant or getting me on a plane somehow. My life is at a good place right now where I still get to do what I want to do but it’s not too crazy, famewise.</p><h3>What’s your all-time-favorite NKOTB song?</h3><p>I’m partial to “Please Don’t Go Girl” because I get to sing that. I still enjoy singing it and it still has a lot of meaning for me.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7j21mamtfn7ymxYymmqKmpK6%2FpnnWmqpmmV2osKm51JyiZq%2BYmrtur8Csq6Kml2K1qr%2BMsKCfnV2bvLN5069krKCfrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
