Take Britney Spears and Kevin Federline for example.

The Princess of Pop met the Fresno, California, native in April 2004 at Joseph’s in Hollywood in the midst of her Onyx Hotel Tour. Federline had danced for LFO when the boy band opened for Spears on her (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour in 2000, but the two never interacted until that fateful nightclub run-in.</p><p>Less than three months later, the “Toxic” singer and K-Fed were engaged. (At the time, he was expecting his second child with ex-fiancée <a href=#><strong>Shar Jackson</strong></a>.) Spears and Federline documented their whirlwind romance and <a href=#>September 2004 wedding</a> on their short-lived UPN reality show, Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They welcomed two sons together, <a href=#>Preston</a> and <a href=#>Jayden</a>, before she filed for divorce in November 2006.</p><p>Spears, who has been dating personal trainer <a href=#><strong>Sam Asghari</strong></a> since late 2016, was not the first music artist to marry a backup dancer though</p><p>After her high-profile split from <a href=#><strong>Sean “Diddy” Combs</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> was introduced to <a href=#><strong>Cris Judd</strong></a> in 2000 on the set of her “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” music video. She and the choreographer exchanged vows in September 2001, only to divorce the following June. (The “Jenny From the Block” songstress went on to date another dancer, <a href=#><strong>Casper Smart</strong></a>, before <a href=#>getting engaged</a> to former New York Yankee&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a> in March 2019.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Mel B</strong></a> also had a short-lived marriage to one of her dancers — and, like Spears, got a child out of it. The Spice Girl started seeing <strong>Jimmy Gulzar</strong> in 1998 during the Spiceworld tour. They got engaged that May, and she announced her pregnancy just weeks later. After saying “I do” in September 1998, Mel B and Gulzar welcomed their daughter, Phoenix, in February 1999. The pair separated 11 months later and finalized their divorce in November 2000.</p><p>Scroll down to see more stars who have dated backup dancers!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axksKCfq7JusMCtnJ1lkpawrMHPZpuappOav7R51m1taW5laXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
