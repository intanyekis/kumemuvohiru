The rapper, who started off his own label, Roc-A-Fella Records, back in the 90s, has transcended the hip hop model and is now an astute businessman who now owns a sports management company and stakes in several others.    Forbes has taken a look at all of Jay's assets and they're now claiming that he's the very first rapper to reach billionaire status."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"(He owns 100% of Armand de Brignac and has partial ownership of the other companies.) Then added up his income, subtracting a healthy amount to account for a superstar lifestyle.</p><p>"We checked our numbers with a roster of outside experts to ensure these estimates were fair and conservative.

He released his first album, Reasonable Doubt, in 1996 and has since garnered 14 No.1 albums and 22 Grammys.</p><p>Five years ago, California rapper, producer and businessman Dr. Dre declared himself hip-hop's first billionaire after selling Beats Music to Apple. But, despite his net worth reaching 1.1 billion, state and local taxes bumped it down to just below a billion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nmpbGbsaMm5ycp52awG60yKlkoaegqHqntdGsq2aamaG5qrvNmqCrnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
