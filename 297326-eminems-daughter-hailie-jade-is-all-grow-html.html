Eminem's daughter became one of the youngest Guinness Word Record holders 20 years ago, and today she remembers her unique childhood being "surreal."</p><p class=dh>Eminem has fathered three beautiful women, and the rapper felt being a dad was his most significant accomplishment. His youngest daughter is Stevie Laine Scott, born to his ex-wife Kim Scott Mathers and the late professional tattoo artist Eric Hartter. Eminem adopted Stevie Laine in 2005.</p><p class=dh>He also adopted Kim's niece in the early 2000s, Alaina Marie Scott, who spent most of her life with the former couple. Alaina Marie's mother, Dawn, battled substance abuse and, therefore, could not care for her daughter. The second youngest of Eminem's children is Hailie Jaide, whom he shares with Kim.</p><p class=dh>Hailie Jade maintains a strong relationship with her dad. She recently accompanied "The Real Slim Shady" artist as he received his new Rock and Roll Hall of Famer status at the 37th Annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. They both sported complimenting black leather jackets.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Hailie Jade Scott Mathers Is Eminem's Only Biological Child</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Hailie Jade drew her first breath in Detroit, Michigan, on December 25, 1995. Her parents met as teenagers and married years later, in 1990. However, their substance abuse and poverty-stricken situation complicated their relationship, and they often fought, even after their daughter was born.</p><p class=dh>Hailie Jade witnessed these fights, which reportedly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/hailie-jade-mathers-childhood-eminem-relationship/>escalated to violence</a>. Things settled after Eminem and Kim finally separated, with the rapper signing a lucrative record deal, and Hailie Jade gained a sense of normalcy in her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f15364b74b5cde2bd2db3fa202fde1a6.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Eminem and Hailie Jade Mathers are photographed the 37th Annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Microsoft Theater on November 05, 2022, in Los Angeles | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>While <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/eminem-proud-daughter-hailie-going-to-college-having-no-babies/>discussing parenthood</a>, her dad stressed the importance of keeping his kids "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvSySR8RdzY&feature=emb_title">grounded</a>," as Hailie Jade and her sisters grew up under a prying spotlight. So, she attended the Chippewa Valley High School, a public school in Clinton Charter Township.</p><p class=dh>After graduating, Hailie Jade enrolled in Michigan State College, where she attained a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/all-about-eminem-children/>degree in Psychology</a> with a 3.9 GPA. In her sophomore year, she joined a sorority and soon met her longtime beau. While Hailie Jade hasn't decided on a career path, she's currently working as an influencer.</p><p class=dh>Her Instagram account boasted <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/hailiejade/>2.9 million followers</a> at the time of publication. She fills her page mostly with stunning photos where she flaunts her outfits, does sponsored ads with big brands, or updates her followers on her latest adventures and vacations.</p><p class=dh>Hailie Jade is also a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/justalittleshadypodcast/>podcaster</a>, hosting "Just a Little Shady" with her childhood best friend, Brittany Ednie. She covers various topics, including beauty and make-up, and has even invited her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/all-about-eminem-children/>older sister</a> Alaina Marie to be on the show.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Hailie Jade Had a Very Unusual Childhood</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In July this year, Hailie Jade shared some warm <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.insider.com/eminem-daughter-opens-up-about-her-surreal-childhood-2022-7>childhood memories</a> on her podcast with Brittany. They remembered a time when Eminem invited Brittany onto his tour bus. To their young minds, owning a tour bus must've been something every dad did. So while it was exciting, it didn't seem like a big deal.</p><p class=dh>Another shared childhood memory involved a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GeuD6hmYXs">trip to Disneyland</a> in Florida, where Hailie Jade's dad had organized a "princess tea-party" for her and Brittany. The father of three even had princess costumes ready for them to wear.</p><p class=dh>As excited as they were at the time, they've grown to treasure those memories more as adults. Hailie Jade even described them as "surreal," as the influencer realized that not all children grew up the same way she did.</p><p class=dh>However, as fondly as she remembered those experiences, others caused some emotional turmoil. Hailie Jade watched her parents battle with substance abuse. In high school, she was terrified of associating with other teenagers involved in underage drinking.</p><p class=dh>Despite avoiding doing anything that would lead to punishment, she was afraid that hanging out with underage drinkers would only get her in trouble. During the premiere episode of her podcast, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GeuD6hmYXs">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I feel like everyone was doing that but I just didn't. I was so naive to all of it."</p><p class=dh>At some stage, Hailie Jade realized that some of the things she actively avoided were normal for high schoolers. After joining a sorority in her sophomore year, Brittany remembered how she began loosening up more. Although she became popular in college, she maintained a strong focus on her books.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Hailie Jade Holds a Guinness World Record Title</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In August 2002, Halie Jade featured in her dad's song "My Dad's Gone Crazy" from his "The Eminem Show" album. When the song charted, she earned the Guinness World Record title for being the youngest – 6 years and 210 days old – performer or <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/3465991/hailie-mathers-boyfriend-evan-mcclintock/>chart entrant</a> to be credited with an RnB hit.</p><p class=dh>Eminem has dedicated several other songs to Haili Jade, with some of the most notable ones being "Mockingbird," "When I'm Gone," and "Hailie's Song." He also mentions Alaina Marie and <a class="me a" href=#>Stevie Laine Scott</a> in his music, though not as much as he did Hailie Jade.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Hailie Jade Is in a Happy Relationship with Evan McClintock</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Hailie Jade and Evan McClintock's relationship began in 2016, as the couple attended the same college. Evan attained a degree in Economics from Michigan State University. He currently holds the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/3465991/hailie-mathers-boyfriend-evan-mcclintock/>Enterprise Growth Executive</a> position at the investigation management company Scout.</p><p class=dh>Evan keeps his Instagram account private but frequently appears on his girlfriend's page. A source close to the couple claimed that Hailie Jade's dad and her family approved of him. The source also said that the couple preferred enjoying cozy nights inside to going out partying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcGtia3qmucinnKarXZmutrPHrZyrZZiWtq21xGahmpyVYra0ecClo2afoqTEb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
