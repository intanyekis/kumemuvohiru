Her Instagram, with a little over half a million followers, features stunning selfies worthy of a TikTok influencer. These&nbsp;high-fashion photos go alongside quick, goofy snapshots of everyday life as if to balance her feed with a little normalcy. The 18-year-old has also been silent on Twitter since 2017 when she had her star moment alongside her sisters at the Golden Globes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylvester Stallone for a father and Jennifer Flavin</a> (entrepreneur, business owner, and former model) for a mother, one would think that Scarlet would take her time in the limelight. However, her sisters Sistine Rose and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophia Rose</a>, both Instagram influencers and models, tend to be the focus of social media attention.</p><p>So, what makes Scarlet Stallone so interesting? She may be the quietest of her sisters on social media, but her family argues that she is anything but quiet. (In a 2017 interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Scarlet revealed that she was the most outgoing out of the three Stallone sisters. She even got detention a few times in high school for talking!) And according to her siblings, Scarlet is bright, talented, and making her own name for herself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Lesser-Known Facts About Sylvester Stallone's Daughter, Sistine</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scarlet-s-personal-life>Scarlet’s Personal Life</h2><p>Scarlet turned 18 back in May, and since then she appears to be having a somewhat normal quarantine. She was last spotted dining out in Beverly Hills with her sister Sistine and her parents in June. According to News Break, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet and Sistine did not wear masks outside</a> despite the recommendations of the CDC, though Sylvester and Jennifer did.</p><p>Scarlet is also somewhat tight-lipped about her dating life, but she did post a cozy video of herself and her boyfriend in celebration of her 18th birthday. Not much is known about her boyfriend and whether or not the pair is still dating.</p><p>Still, many fans have wondered what Sylvester Stallone has had to say about Scarlet’s beau. He is known for being extremely protective of his daughters, having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">written on Instagram in 2019</a> under a photo of Sophia, Sistine, and Scarlet: “Remember, I’m watching you guys!… #PapaBearInTheHouse #Rambo Is my close friend.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“What is this?” Scarlet commented under the photo, calling her dad out on his shenanigans.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylvester Stallone's Daughters Are All Grown Up: 20 Pics Of What They Look Like Today</a></span></p><h2 id=why-scarlet-hasn-t-taken-on-more-acting-gigs>Why Scarlet Hasn’t Taken On More Acting Gigs</h2><p>A quick search on IMDB reveals that Scarlet Stallone hasn’t had much acting experience, which seems odd given her father’s success. In 2014, she has a small role as a “sassy young girl” in the movie Reach Me, in which Sylvester Stallone played Gerald.</p><p>Scarlet revealed in the 2017 interview why this tiny role was her first and also her last. “I literally just had to say one tiny line,” she said with a groan. “And they had to cut it in half! It was pretty humiliating.”</p><p>In fact, all three Stallone sisters have said that they don’t have the acting bug like their dad. Still, Sistine managed to land a role in 47 Meters Down: Uncaged, a 2019 horror-drama. Will Scarlet ever follow in Sistine’s footsteps and take another stab at the acting thing? Only time will tell, though Scarlet has hinted in the past that she may be more interested in modeling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Of The Stallone Sisters That'll Make Sylvester Go Rambo</a></span></p><h2 id=scarlet-s-older-sisters-love-to-tease-her>Scarlet's Older Sisters Love to Tease Her</h2><p>While it looks as though Scarlet has big shoes to fill, since both her older sisters have exactly 1.3 million Instagram followers and work as models, there seems to be no bad blood between these three star-studded Stallones. In fact, the&nbsp;sisters are incredibly close, and Sophia and Sistine thoroughly enjoy teasing Scarlet.</p><p>In the 2017 Harper’s Bazaar interview, Sophia and Sistine both agreed that Scarlet is the clumsiest sister. The conversation came up after the three attended the Golden Globes as Golden Globes Ambassadors. Though none of them slipped while escorting presenters on and off stage, they all agreed that Scarlet would have been the likeliest to trip.</p><p>“She’s very clumsy,” Sistine joked in the interview. “I’m not used to wearing heels,” Scarlet admitted. “I’m like a giraffe.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sophia and Sistine tend to crack jokes on Scarlet’s Instagram as well. On July 26, Scarlet posted a picture of a coconut cake in a torn-open box with a fork sticking out of the center. The caption reads, “needed to share.”</p><p>“You look so pretty in this,” Sistine teased in the comments.</p><p>Fortunately, all the teasing comes with a close sister bond. Scarlet, Sophia, and Sistine regularly pose for photos together and complement each other on their selfies. The trio seems as solid as ever and still finds time to spend with their parents during quarantine.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising BTS Facts About Sylvester Stallone's Biggest Movies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv9ilrZ6rpJq%2Fbr%2FTmqOlp56awG7Fzq6loJ2jqXqlrdSgn62domLApK3RpZytZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
