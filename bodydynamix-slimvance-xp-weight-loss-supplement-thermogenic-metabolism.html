We got a running start on our <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">weight loss and wellness journey</a>, diving into workout challenges and meal-prep plans, determined to keep up with our resolutions. The weeks started to pass, however, and the number on the scale hardly budged — if at all. All of this work for zero results? This is why staying motivated is so difficult.</p><p>You haven’t hit a dead end though. There is another thing you can try, and it doesn’t require any extra burpees or push-ups. If you’re looking to lose weight, a supplement could be key. There are plenty of great supplements out there, but this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">new thermogenic from BodyDynamix</a> is our suggestion if you’re serious about making a change. Ready to boost that metabolism and start shedding inches off your waist? It’s time we introduced you to Slimvance XP!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/slimvance-xp-container.jpg><p><strong>Get the new <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BodyDynamix Slimvance XP Thermogenic</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$60</a> at GNC with free shipping! Buy one, get another 50% off for a limited time!</strong></p><p>Slimvance already held the title of GNC’s fastest <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> ingredients, and the new <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Slimvance XP</a> only takes things up a notch. This “metabolism igniter” is designed to help you burn more calories and slim down your waist and hips. You don’t need to be a fitness buff to use it — you just need to be willing to take a few seconds out of your day to take it!</p><p>Reviewers are already reporting great results from this supplement, one saying they “lost five pounds in the first two weeks” while another “used it for 10 days and [lost] three pounds” already. One even reported that it offered a “great pump of energy” for their workouts, which is always a plus for Us!</p><p>There are two key ingredients in this product. Slimvance, as we mentioned earlier, is a patented, clinically-studied herbal blend made to reduce body weight and BMI in a matter of weeks. It’s designed to provide six times more weight loss when combined with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Slimvance diet and exercise plan</a>. How do we know it’s legit? A randomized clinical study of 140 healthy overweight people showed that those on Slimvance lost almost 10 more pounds than those who took a placebo after 16 weeks, along with losing over an inch around the hips and over an inch around the waist. Those on Slimvance also had improved BMI compared to the placebo group after about a month!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/slimvance-xp-box.jpg><p><strong>Get the new <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BodyDynamix Slimvance XP Thermogenic</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$60</a> at GNC with free shipping! Buy one, get another 50% off for a limited time!</strong></p><p>The other key ingredient is AfperFIT, a natural, clinically-studied botanical that may help kick-start your calorie burning and weight loss. In a randomized, double blind study, 70 men and women took a placebo or AfperFIT and followed their routine diet and exercise regimen for 12 weeks. Results showed that those taking AfperFIT burned an additional 171 more calories per day after 12 weeks compared to the placebo group. That’s major!</p><p>To incorporate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Slimvance XP</a> into your life, simply take one serving twice per day. It’s recommended that you take one in the morning and another four to six hours later, around 30 to 60 minutes before a workout. Try not to take your second serving within the three to four hours before bed.</p><p>Sound like you need some of this thermogenic in your life? You’re probably already going to add it to your cart, but we highly suggest adding two right now. For a limited time, you can grab two and get the second for 50% off. That’s $30 in savings!</p><p><strong>Get the new <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BodyDynamix Slimvance XP Thermogenic </a>for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$60</a> at GNC with free shipping!
