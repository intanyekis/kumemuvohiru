Kate, unattached and free, soaks in the southern sunshine in a skimpy purple bikini.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“This show should be called ‘Kate Plus Kate’ because mommy does everything,” one of the sextuplets says. In another tense moment from the show, Kate reflects on how her eldest daughters, Mady and Cara, are rapidly growing up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Sometimes moms of teenagers think that things are funny,” she quips, while her embarrassed high school-aged girls look flustered and embarrassed. In one scene, Kate also tries preventing the girls from going out with a few teenage boys.</p><p>While the busy mom spends the majority of her time tending to the kids, she considers dipping back into the dating pool — and with a cute guy, too. “This is your first blind date,” someone remarks. Kate seems to like this gentlemen, who whisks her through NYC in a limo and a romantic helicopter ride. (Sigh.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>How does the night conclude? “Yeah, I don’t know. What is the proper end-of-date goodnight?” she says. “I don’t know.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>By the way, she didn’t tell her kids she was dating again.</p><p>Watch the preview above, and tune in to the premiere on TLC on Tuesday, Dec. 8, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJVitLC%2F0p6joqZdqb%2BqsdJmm5qsmaO0bsPEmqmsZaOgtq682GaZoqOZo7Zutc1mopqslWK9rcHSZm9mamBmgnJ%2BkGpm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
