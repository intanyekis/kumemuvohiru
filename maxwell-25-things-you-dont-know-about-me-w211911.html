My first job was as a dishwasher at Pizza Hut.</p><p>2. Before a show, I like a thick pasta with Alfredo sauce to lubricate the vocal cords.</p><p>3. Have to say, I love a good manicure and pedicure.</p><p>4. I sometimes travel with an inversion table to do sit-ups and keep the blood rushing to my vocal cords.</p><p>5. I really enjoy the work I’m doing with APJ (Artists for Peace and&nbsp;<span>Justice), which serves poor families in Haiti through educational, health care and arts programs.</span></p><p>6. I wear sunglasses almost every day. My favorites are the Louis Vuittons I wore in the “Lake by the Ocean” video.</p><p>7. I love pop-culture TV — I watch <i>Game of Thrones</i> and <i>House of Cards</i>.</p><p>8. I usually wear a suit to perform because I feel the music and audience deserve the respect of good attire.</p><p>9. I generally eat very healthy — almost vegan — but every now and then I gotta rock a good steak!</p><p>10. I love bike riding around New York City. It gives me a chance to clear my head.</p><p>11. When I’m asked to do commercial projects, I ask myself, “Is this something <b>Marvin Gaye</b> would do?”</p><p>12. I just discovered Mason Pearson hairbrushes and they are game changers.</p><p>13. I love older comedians, but I do love the younger generation, like <b>Key and Peele</b>.</p><p>14. My favorite drink is Hibiki or Yamazaki whiskey. The older, the better.</p><p>15. I still get nervous before performing.</p><p>16. I always have fresh orchids at home.</p><p>17. I’m a big fan of <b>Carmelo Anthony</b> and the New York Knicks.</p><p>18. I haven’t settled down yet, but I’m getting close. I haven’t found the right woman. Music is my mistress.</p><p>19. I would love a pet, like a great dog, but I am on the road, so I don’t feel right about getting one right now.</p><p>20. I recently got to spend time with one of my idols, <b>Harry Belafonte</b>.</p><p>21. My music is inspired by my life experiences, so I take time between doing music to experience life.</p><p>22. I collect art and appreciate and love its creative process.</p><p>23. Some of my latest kicks are from a French brand called Ami (the French word for friend). They’re pretty fly.</p><p>24. When I travel, I never leave without my Vocier supersmart luggage. Basically, I never need to worry about my stuff being creased.</p><p>25. My favorite thing about what I do is the people I get to do it with.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaissq24jGtsZqyYnruov4yypq5llKS7tXnKp6awZZGXvLbAjKacZq9iZn56fZBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
