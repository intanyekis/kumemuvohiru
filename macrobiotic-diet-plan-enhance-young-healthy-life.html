The diet plan is low in fat, high in fiber and is basically a vegan plan. The diet plan promises to get you young, healthy, and slender body.</p><p>Many Hollywood celebrities such as, <a title="Madonna Height Weight Body Statistics" href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Madonna</strong></a>, <a title="Gwyneth Paltrow Height Weight Body Statistics" href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></a>, <a title="Alicia Silverstone Height Weight Body Statistics" href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Alicia Silverstone</strong></a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>John Travolta</strong></a>, and numerous others are strict fans of this diet plan and have been able to maintain them in perfect shape just by following the diet plan.</p><p>Originated in Japan, Macrobiotic diet plan is a perfect blend of Zen Buddhism and western lifestyle. Except for occasional fish and meat, all other animal foods are banished in the diet plan. Spirituality being vital is to be maintained while going along with the diet plan.</p><h3><b>Principles of Macrobiotic Diet Plan</b></h3><p>Macrobiotic diet plan talks about bringing balance between yin and yang foods. These two forces control all the areas of life. However, they both are contrary to each other. While yin is cold, sweet, and passive, yang is hot, salty and aggressive.</p><p>For good health, it’s critical to maintain harmony between both the forces. Food items in the diet plan have been categorized into yin and yang. Foods such as whole grains and vegetables have equal properties of both yin and yang and therefore have been included in the mainstream of diet plan. The diet plan recommends refraining from foods having extreme yin or yang properties.</p><h3><b>Who can follow Macrobiotic Diet Plan?</b></h3><p>The plan shall be designed and monitored by nutrition experts only.

Soy products being opulent source of phytoestrogen can effectively curb the formation of estrogen based cancer such as breast cancer in your body.</p><p>Due to being low in saturated fats and high in phytoestrogen, the diet program can purge females from several physiological problems such as premenstrual syndrome, menopause, endometriosis, and breast cancer.</p><h3><b>Recommended Food Items of Macrobiotic Diet Plan</b></h3><p>Let’s have a look at some of the recommended food items of Macrobiotic diet plan.</p><p><b>Whole Grains</b> – Having the most proportionate ratio of yin and yang, whole grains are strongly recommended. 50 – 60% of daily diet should have whole grains such as barley, rice, millet, oats, rye, corn, buckwheat, wheat, brown rice etc. Though the diet program recommends only whole grains, however, you still can have small portions of pasta and bread made of refined flour.</p><p><b>Vegetables</b> – 25 – 30% of daily diet should have vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, collards, cauliflower, mustard greens, turnip, bok choy, kale, mustard green, turnip greens, onions, butternut, pumpkin, squash, acorn squash, daikon radish etc.</p><p>You can have occasional vegetables, which means you can consume them two to three times in a week. They are – mushrooms, celery, snow peas, iceberg lettuce, string beans etc. You shall steam the vegetables. You can add little corn or sesame oil to improve the taste.</p><p><b>Sea Vegetables and Beans</b> – 5 to 10% of your daily diet should emanate from sea vegetables and beans such as lentils, tofu, adzuki beans, chickpeas, hijiki, nori, kombu etc.</p><p><b>Soups </b>– Soups should contribute 5 to 10% of your daily food intake.
