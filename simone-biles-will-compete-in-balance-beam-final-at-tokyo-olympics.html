I simply got so lost [that] my safety was at risk as well as a team medal. … I also have no idea how I landed on my feet on that vault bc if you look at the pictures & my eyes you can see how confused I am as to where I am in the air.”</p><p>Biles subsequently withdrew from the <a href=#>uneven bars and vault competitions</a>.</p><p>The athlete has since received a massive show of support from celebrities and fellow gymnasts, including <a href=#><strong>Nastia Liukin</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Aly Raisman</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Simone-Biles-Will-Compete-in-Balance-Beam-Final-at-the-Tokyo-Olympics-2.jpg><p>“No one will be remembered for any single routine, competition, or medal,” the Finding My Shine author, 31, wrote via Instagram on Wednesday, July 28. “You, however, will undeniably be remembered by many for the compassion and bravery shown here in Tokyo.
