They have sold over 60 million records worldwide, making them one of the biggest selling girl groups of all time. Her first audition on The X Factor was “You Oughta Know” by Alanis Morissette. With Jesy Nelson, they were put in a group called Faux Pas while Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock were put in a group named Orion. Both groups, however, failed to progress. Later, a decision was made to bring back the four to form the four-piece group Rhythmix, and they progressed to judges’ houses. They eventually reached the live shows and were mentored by Tulisa Contostavlos. On 28 October 2011, it was announced that the group’s new name would be Little Mix.
