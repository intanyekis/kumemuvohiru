That was in 2017, so Facebook Live was still new, but I would do Lives and YouTube videos about my day, my auditions ... and then I started giving tips to anyone who was watching."</p><p>Soon enough, her audience began to grow, and Christine even racked up some regular viewers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: 'Hawkeye' Star Adetinpo Thomas On Why She Left Business For Acting</a></span></p><p>Eventually, those loving her tips wanted more.</p><p><strong>"People started asking if I'd coach them, and I was like, 'I like money - sure!'"</strong> she laughs.</p><p>"It got to a point where I realized, I'm definitely connected to media, and I'm an entrepreneur at heart - so when I see an opportunity, I'm not blind to it."</p><p><strong>"From there, it just grew, and not just on the coaching side. That grew into a community, which is now called Hollywood Bound Actors. We have a Facebook community, the YouTube channel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a podcast</a>, and I do a conference once a year called Booking Magnet Live,"</strong> she beams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-39-s-become-the-coach-she-wished-she-39-d-had>She's Become The Coach She Wished She'd Had</h2><p>Christine might not have planned to become a coach, but it's not exactly surprising that she went that route.</p><p>After all, she's become the coach she once wished she had, starting out in the industry.</p><p><strong>"I remember being in this industry and struggling, wishing someone would just give me any nugget or piece of advice, and feeling alone and stuck,"</strong> she muses.</p><p>"I thought, if I can be a beacon of light in any way to somebody else, that's what I want to be."</p><p>Mission accomplished, there!</p><p>However, we can't help but wonder: if she had had a coach, earlier in her career, what would she have loved to learn from them?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Adetinpo Thomas Tells Us The 1 Thing She Wishes She'd Known About Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Or - since she's become the coach of her dreams - what piece of advice would she give her younger self?</p><p>"I would remind myself that this is still show <strong>business</strong> . There's a business part of the show. You can have as much talent as anybody else, but unless you know how to navigate this <strong>business</strong> , it's going to be quite challenging."</p><p><strong>"A lot of us are artists, and we just want to perform,"</strong> she continues, <strong>"But you have to know about marketing, connecting, and putting yourself out there.

I read books on how to be a better person - and the more connected you are to yourself as a human being, the more tapped in you can be for your characters, or for anything!"</p><p><strong>"So," </strong>she smiles, concluding our conversation, <strong>"You will never go wrong with changing your thoughts.
