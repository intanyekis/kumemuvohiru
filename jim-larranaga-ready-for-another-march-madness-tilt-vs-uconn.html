That was how Folarin Campbell remembered the classic Elite Eight showdown with overall No. 1 seed Connecticut 17 years ago last Sunday.
The No. 11 Patriots were coming off of upsets of higher seeds Michigan State, North Carolina and Wichita State, and were within one win of a stunning 2006 Final Four berth. Standing in their way were the heavily favored Huskies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The game plan, guard Lamar Butler recalled, was simple.</p><p>The George Mason coach told his players they could outscore UConn. He had that much belief in them.</p><p>“He said, ‘Go score,’ and that’s what we did,” Butler said.</p><p>Larranaga, a Bronx native who played for Jack Curran at Archbishop Molloy, has this soothing way about him that can relax players in the face of pressure, Campbell said.</p><p>The Verizon Center in Washington was at capacity, ear-splitting loud.</p><p>But Larranaga was able to keep the Patriots calm.</p><p>At halftime, with Connecticut up nine, Larranaga said, “We’ve got the guys right where we want them. And they were like, ‘What do you mean?’ I said they think the game is over. They’re ahead and there’s no stopping them. We’ve just begun to play.”</p><p>Prior to overtime, Larranaga gathered everyone in the huddle and told them: “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere in the world but here.”</p><p>“He just found ways to keep everybody at ease,” remembered Campbell, who works at the school on its developmental staff. “It just made us play free.”</p><p>Butler, who now coaches at Paul VI High School (Va.) and with Team Takeover on the AAU circuit, tries to emulate Larranaga’s style, particularly when it comes to external factors.</p><p>Pressure, Larranaga has told players for years, is mental. All that matters is the present. He likes to say, “play the game, not the score.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">George Mason’s head coach Jim Larranaga talks to his team in overtime against Connecticut.

Caputo was with him until this past season, and said the FBI Investigation into corruption in college basketball that involved the Hurricanes set them back.</p><p>Miami suffered through three straight losing seasons before reaching the Elite Eight last year and the Final Four this year.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Jim Larranaga <span class=credit>Sporting News via Getty Images</span></figure><p>At a time when older coaches such as Roy Williams, Mike Krzyzewski and Jay Wright have moved on in the wake of the transfer portal and Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) era, Larranaga has adapted.</p><p>He’s built the Hurricanes through the portal, landing key players on this year’s team such as Nijel Pack (Kansas State) and Norchad Omier (Arkansas State), and has a shot to win his first national title this weekend.</p><p>Larranaga is two wins from becoming the oldest coach to ever win a national title. Calhoun, at 68, was the oldest coach to cut down the nets at the Final Four.</p><p>“Coach L is like the OG of coaching now. He’s the last one standing,” Butler said. “Definitely deserves his flowers. It’s really astonishing to be honest.”</p><p>Ironically, Larranaga’s second Final Four trip will feature him facing the same team he had to get past to reach his first Final Four.</p><p>The two March runs were very different, but similar in their meaning to the man who engineered them.</p><p>George Mason remains one of the great Cinderella stories.</p><p>With Miami, Larranaga has proven he is still one of the premier coaches in the nation at the age of 73.</p><p>“It’s the same exhilaration,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmbGhfn7auecuaqauZnpa0onnRnpidsV2bvLN5wKemraCVp3qurdGcn2alkZm7pr%2FSZquipKRiw7R51Jymp6Zf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
