After more than a decade in the National Football League, Kelce has recently stolen the hearts of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>’s fans as they root for the musician and the athlete’s<a href=#> reported romance</a>.</p><p>From the start, Kelce took a cue from the Swifties. Swift’s fans are known to trade friendship bracelets at her Eras Tour shows, and Kelce planned on <a href=#>asking her out</a> by making her a bracelet with his phone number on in July.</p><p>“I wanted to give Taylor Swift [a bracelet] with <a href=#>my number on it</a>,” Kelce said on an episode of his “New Heights” podcast. “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings so I was a little butt-hurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.”</p><p>Two months later, Swift <a href=#>broke the the brains</a> of both of their fanbases when she accepted Kelce’s invite to<a href=#> watch him play</a> at <a href=#>Arrowhead Stadium</a> in September.</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn everything there is to know on Kelce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Swiftie-Guide-to-Travis-Kelce-Everything-to-Know-3.jpg><h3>Where Is Kelce From?</h3><p>Kelce is from Westlake, Ohio and attended Cleveland Heights High School. He now resides in Kansas City.</p><h3>Where Did He Go to College?</h3><p>Kelce attended the <a href=#>University of Cincinnati</a> from 2008 to 2012. He majored in Exploratory Studies and was awarded a scholarship from the school to play football. In 2010, he was suspended from playing for a year after failing a marijuana test, and his scholarship was taken away.</p><p>In a July episode of the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Bussin’ With The Boys”</a> podcast, Kelce opened up about transitioning from quarterback to tight end after his suspension. “What it did was it really kicked me into the tight end room. I was still playing QB then,” he said at the time. “It was like, ‘Alright, you can come walk on the team, but we don’t need a quarterback. You can just be an athlete on scout team for a year, we’ll figure it out.’”</p><h3>What Is Kelce’s Football Position?</h3><p>A tight end is an offensive player who has several potential roles in the game. Sometimes (more often than not for Kelce), the tight end acts as a receiver — and Kelce has found a lot of success connecting with Chiefs quarterback<a href=#><strong> Patrick Mahomes</strong></a> in the endzone. (Following the first game Swift attended, Mahomes told reporters Kelce often makes up his own routes.) The tight end can also serve as an offensive lineman, protecting the quarterback during passing plays or blocking on running plays.</p><p>Kelce’s jersey number is 87.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Swiftie-Guide-to-Travis-Kelce-Everything-to-Know-5.jpg><h3>Has Kelce Always Played for the Chiefs?</h3><p>Kelce has played on the Chiefs for his whole career and has major success on the field.
