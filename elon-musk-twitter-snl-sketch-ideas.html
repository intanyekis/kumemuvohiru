Fans have their eyes locked on the May 8th episode and are counting down the days until this sheer entertainment unfolds, and as the day draws nearer, Musk has engaged his fans by taking to Twitter and asking for topic ideas and help with the content he'll be presenting.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk Giving Away $100 Million In XPrize Carbon Removal Competition</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether viewers are fans of Musk or not, chances are they're getting ready t<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">o tune in just to see what happens</a> when he takes the spotlight as the host of the show. Already dubbed as being a train wreck in the making, many people share a total lack of confidence in the fact that Musk truly has what it takes to pull this off. Most viewers are expecting him to mess up in an epic way, and want to be watching when things start to fall apart.</p><p>It seems that Musk has already started with the mockery and took to Twitter to share some content ideas with fans and gauge what they think he should be speaking about when he has possession of the microphone.</p><p>Clearly not one to care what others think he should say, it's obvious that Musk is already toying with the audience and starting to generate hype and buzz surrounding, what is sure to be, a very unpredictable hour of wild commentary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seemingly taunting fans to start up with the controversial comments, Musk turned to Twitter to say; “Throwing out some skit ideas for SNL. What should I do?”</p><p>He then went on to test the waters with&nbsp;some of his own concepts such as; “Woke James Bond,” “Baby Shark & Shark Tank merge to form Baby Shark Tank,” and “Irony Man – defeats villains using the power of irony.”</p><p>Some fans were amused and kept the conversation going, while others snapped back with remarks such as; "Extraterrestrials found<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> your Tesla Roadster </a>sent to space in 2018 & are trying to figure out what it is,” and a slew of others that were far less kind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he sent his own SpaceX vessel into space </a>and followed up with a tweet that said; "a bunch of people will probably die” during&nbsp;this planned Mars mission, viewers can't even begin to predict what sort of commentary he'll come up with when he hosts Saturday Night Live on May 8th. The one thing they do know is they'll be watching to find out.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech Giants Dominate Forbes 2021 Billionaires List</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Page Six</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyrbvNZqSuq5tiwbi1062cq2Wjo7luv8qeq5ygXZ6xpq3SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
