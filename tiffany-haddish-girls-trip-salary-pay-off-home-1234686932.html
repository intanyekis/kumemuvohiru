So before we even got into season 2 of&nbsp;The Carmichael Show, I bought a house.

Between that show’s next season,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the&nbsp;Keanu movie</a>, and making sure I can live comfortably off of $500 a month, I was able to pay off half the house. The&nbsp;Girls Trip&nbsp;check was the final check. People told me to spend it in other ways, but I used it to pay off the house because I was always afraid of being homeless again.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Expressing that she never wants to be broke again, she went on to say, “Now I have a surplus of money, but I’m still afraid of being poor again.
