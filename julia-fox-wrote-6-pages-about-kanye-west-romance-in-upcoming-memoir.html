“It’s like six pages,” Fox, 33, told E! News on Thursday, September 7, about how much detail fans can expect about the rapper, 46, in the book. “I feel like I went very lightly on it. I’m not trying to have bad blood or anything, it’s all in the past.”
Fox and West enjoyed a whirlwind romance in early 2022, dating for two months after meeting in Miami on New Year’s Eve and later, enjoying a dinner together in New York."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

News</a> on Thursday, September 7, about how much detail fans can expect about the rapper, 46, in the book. “I feel like I went very lightly on it. I’m <a href=#>not trying to have bad blood</a> or anything, it’s all in the past.”</p><p>Fox and West enjoyed <a href=#>a whirlwind romance</a> in early 2022, dating for two months after meeting in Miami on New Year’s Eve and later, enjoying a dinner together in New York. That same month, Fox opened up about her “instant connection” to West.</p><p>“His energy is so fun to be around,” she told<a href=#> Interview</a> magazine at the time. “He had me and my friends laughing, dancing and smiling all night.”</p><p>West made his first public appearance with Fox at the Kenzo show during <a href=#>Paris Fashion Week</a> that January, with the <a href=#>couple twinning</a> in all denim looks. The <a href=#>Uncut Gems</a> star rocked a cropped jean jacket and <a href=#>low-rise pants</a> while the Yeezy designer wore a puffy denim jacket and light-wash pants.</p><p>One month later, West helped plan Fox’s 32nd birthday party at a New York City restaurant in February 2022. “It was a great time,” an insider told Us Weekly after the event. “Kanye and Julia were looking cozy with [their] arms wrapped around one another.” The two split later that month, after West publicly pleaded to reunite with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>. “Julia and Kanye remain good friends and collaborators but they are<a href=#> no longer together</a>,” Fox’s rep confirmed to Us at the time.</p><p>Nine months later, Fox reflected on her relationship with West in a since-deleted TikTok video after a social media user accused her of “dating a famously violent misogynist <a href=#>and antisemite.</a>” (West came under fire for a series of<a href=#> antisemitic tweets</a> in October 2022.)</p><p>“I was delusional and thought I could help him, but it didn’t work and now we’re here but that being said, I really deeply respect the man as an artist,” Fox said in the clip. “I don’t want to s–t on that. I don’t want to reduce his whole career to his really bad moments.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>West previously was married to Kardashian, 44,&nbsp;from May 2014 to November 2022, <a href=#>finalizing their divorce</a> nearly two years after Kardashian filed in February 2021.
