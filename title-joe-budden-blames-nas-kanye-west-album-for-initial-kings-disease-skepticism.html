“Salute to Nas, salute to Queens — ‘Ultra Black’ sounds amazing in the scheme of the album,” Budden said. “It’s perfect. And, the content kind of does a good job of covering what you’re talking about in the whole album."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And, the content kind of does a good job of covering what you’re talking about in the whole album. And when that happened, boy did I feel stupid. I said, ‘Man, that’s what the song is supposed to do.’ So I cannot like the song and understand where he was coming from. In the scheme of the album, that song is a pleasure to fucking hear.”</p><p>Budden then went on to apologize to several guests on the Nas album, including Fivio Foreign, Brucie B, A$AP Ferg, Big Sean, Charlie Wilson and Don Toliver.</p><p></p><p>Budden explained Nas’ 2018 studio album, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Kanye West-produced</a> NASIR,&nbsp;fed into his initial skepticism.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I’m just saying I didn’t see where some of the features were about to take me because I have been thrown off from that Kanye project,” he continued. “I’m gonna be honest here. A lot of people out there had been asking and inquiring, ‘Hey, is there Nas hate up there?’ No, there’s not Nas hate, but he’s such a great that when it’s not great, you try to just avoid it, not discuss it, not speak about him in his proper place.</p><p>“Not only did Nas deliver, but Hit-Boy did an amazing job. Every one of these features killed. Oh my god! Lil Durkio. Why wasn’t it 40 more bars from Durk!? What I was clearly way off about is, I like hearing Nas with the new guys when it’s done right … I love all the features. I like the album a lot. It makes me proud to come in here and say, ‘Boy you were way off base in this.’ And, I like lovely dovey Nas.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2020/08/nas-bet-e1598040721155.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Nas Dashed His Classic Album Feel When He Released 'Ultra Black' As A Lead Single</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>August 21, 2020</p></a><p>NASIR arrived in June 2018 after several delays.
