It almost became a matter of survival for me, because I didn't have the option to go back home if it didn't work out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having said that, she points out that she worked hard to obtain a Communications degree - something to fall back on, if need be.</p><p>"I worked really hard because I didn't want to ever struggle, like I have in the past."</p><p><strong>"Hopefully,"</strong> she nods, <strong>"It sets me up for life."</strong></p><h2 id=alyssa-reveals-what-she-39-d-tell-her-younger-self>Alyssa Reveals What She'd Tell Her Younger Self</h2><p>Speaking of the struggles she experienced, earlier on in life, we couldn't help but ask Alyssa what she's tell her younger self, if she could.</p><p>More specifically, we asked what she'd tell her 13-year-old self.</p><p>"13 was probably the worst time of my life! I was right in the depths of it all, being in foster care."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I guess," </strong>she muses, before breaking into a smile, <strong>"I would say, it definitely gets much better."</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: Marlo Hampton Reflects On Her Journey From Foster Kid To Philanthropist</a></span></p><p>She also shares that she doesn't think her younger self would be able to comprehend what was in store for her.</p><p>"My dream was just to finish high school. Then, it was finishing college, so I don't think I'd even believe me if I told my younger self all the things I've accomplished."</p><p>While on the topic of what she'd tell her younger self, we also took the opportunity to ask Alyssa if she had advice for young fans hoping to follow in her footsteps - or fans of any age, for that matter.</p><p><strong>"You just cannot fear what the people around you think,"</strong> she urges. <strong>"That's the biggest thing holding you back."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: Tyler Regan Shares Advice For Cross-Country Adventuring (And Creating New Content)</a></span></p><p>"If you really are passionate about something, just put yourself out there.

It's so specific, but I love <strong>Ginny and Georgia</strong> and all those stories. I just think they're so good!"</p><p>Alyssa chuckles that even at 23, those are the stories she relates to most, so being cast in one, <strong>"Would be the ultimate dream."</strong></p><p>Given all she's accomplished thus far, something tells us this is a dream well within reach for Alyssa McKay!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Royals of Malibu</strong></a> is the newest podcast from Diversion Audio.
