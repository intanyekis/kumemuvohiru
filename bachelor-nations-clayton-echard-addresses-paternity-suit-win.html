Echard has repeatedly denied that the pair ever had sexual intercourse. In September 2023, he posted his receipt from a DNA testing company and told fans via Instagram that other men reached out to him detailing <a href=#>similar claims made against them by Owens</a>.</p><p>The court noted Owens’ past claims in Tuesday’s ruling and recommended that Owens be investigated further.</p><p>“It is further ordered, the Court having determined that Laura Owens has a pattern of similar, if not identical behavior, and court involvement, referring this matter to the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office for review of Laura Owen’s actions,” the ruling reads.</p><p>Echard said that he will continue to cooperate with any further investigation into Owens.</p><p>“This morning, the court officially referred Laura Michelle Owens to the county attorney for criminal prosecution. I of course will participate in that matter, but I will not lose sight of who I am,” he said in Tuesday’s Instagram video. “I’ve had my own struggles and I am now committed to helping others.”</p><p>Echard added that it is his “sincere wish that Laura turns over a new leaf and gets the help that she needs.” He said that he “would be the first to embrace her for making a positive change” and asked his followers to “refrain from any commentary that could be misinterpreted as harmful” while discussing the legal victory online.</p><p>“With that being said, the sun shines a little bit brighter today,” he concluded the video statement.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Echard’s lawyer, <strong>Gregg Woodnick</strong>, also celebrated the ruling in a statement to Us.</p><p>“We are pleased with the outcome and Judge Mata’s thorough ruling,” he said on Tuesday. “We hope this is the end of a long saga for all the victims.”</p><p>Echard was a contestant on season 18 of The Bachelorette in 2021 before leading season 26 of The Bachelor the following year. He briefly rekindled his romance with his final contestant,<strong> Susie Evans</strong>, after filming, but the two called it quits in September 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270WalmqyZpLu0ecKlmLKsn6N6pq%2FHmqmdZZGZsbOx0qycrGWglsGmvs2iq7Jlo6q2tXnWoqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
