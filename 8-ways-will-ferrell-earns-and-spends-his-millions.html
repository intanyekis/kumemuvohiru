He was the guy at University of Southern California <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">known for his pranks</a> in the classroom as well as streaking with his fraternity (Delta Tau Delta) but strangely enough, his stand-up comedy routine didn’t always hit the mark.</p><p>The Talladega Nights star found his home in 1995 as a sketch comedian in the popular <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">weekend comedy show, SNL</a>, eventually became the highest paid SNL cast member in 2001 and then one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood with blockbuster hits on the big screen.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Ferrell has a net worth of a whopping $160 million today and the way he earns and spends his millions might surprise you.</p><h2 id=getting-started>Getting Started</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The A Night at the Roxbury&nbsp;star got his start becoming one of SNL’s most popular cast members for his pristine comedic timing and ability to impersonate other famous people like George W. Bush, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Alex Trebek</a> and others. His original characters such as cheerleader Craig Buchanan and night clubber Steve Butabi quickly made <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Ferrell a household name</a> and increased his star power exponentially. In 2001, Ferrell became the highest paid SNL cast member making $17,500 per episode or more than $350,000 per season.</p><h2 id=the-big-screen>The Big Screen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still working at SNL, Ferrell began testing the waters in Hollywood with roles in “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery” and “A Night at the Roxbury” – a film based on his SNL skit along side fellow comedian <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Chris Kattan</a>. By the early 2000’s, Ferrell was pulling in $20 million per film for leading roles in 2003’s “Elf”, 2004’s “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” and 2008’s “Step Brothers”. He’s also known for making famous cameo’s in “<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Wedding Crashers</a>” alongside Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as well as the sitcom “The Office” according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Just Start Investing</a>.</p><h2 id=behind-the-camera>Behind the Camera</h2><p>Ferrell and comedy partner Adam McKay founded Gary Sanchez Productions, putting the A-list star behind the camera as producer of such films like “Get Hard” and television shows like “Succession”. In 2019, the production company closed, ending a decade-long run with classic hits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">14 Famous Faces You Forgot Were Once On SNL</a></span></p><h2 id=business-partner>Business Partner</h2><p>In 2007, Ferrell and business partner McKay and fellow comedian Chris Henchy launched comedy website, Funny or Die. The site produced popular shows like <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Zach Galifianakis</a>’ show “Between Two Ferns” and a decade later, the men sold the site to AMC for a reported $200 million It’s not clear how much of the site Ferrell still owns at this time.</p><h2 id=comedy-screen-writer>Comedy Screen Writer</h2><p>Though many didn’t know it at the time, it was Ferrell’s writing that brought hits like “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby” and “Stepbrothers” to the big screen. Of course, it was Ferrell behind many of the Funny or Die skits as well, proving to audiences he was not only hilarious on screen, but behind it as well.</p><h2 id=investments>Investments</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star became <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">part-owner of the Los Angels Football Club</a> several years ago. In 2019, Forbes valued the team at $475 million, making Ferrell’s investment well worth his time.</p><h2 id=real-estate>Real Estate</h2><p>Also considered an investment but one way Ferrell chooses to spend his millions is by way of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">real estate</a>. He and his auctioneer wife and two sons have lived by rather conservative standards as celebrities go. Ferrell has a New York City loft, featured in Architectural Digest and other home design magazines. The 2600 square foot apartment was once a printing shop according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celeb Casas</a> and after a complete renovation, the space has received attention from some of the top national design companies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Ferrell’s $10 million dollar home in California is 4,000 square feet and sits on a little more than two acres. He purchased the home from <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Ellen DeGeneres</a> in 2006 and it boasts two additional buildings on the property: a recreation building and outdoor dining/living room space.</p><p>Reportedly, Ferrell has taken it easy by way of real estate investment, owning just the two properties and no vacation homes in exotic locations, but perhaps he saves the big spending for charity causes, something Ferrell has shown time and time again, is close to his heart.</p><h2 id=giving-back>Giving Back</h2><p>Though much of Ferrell’s charity work goes under the radar, according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Inquisitr,</a> he may be the first name people call when looking for celebrity faces for a good cause. He’s participated in “Red Nose Day” along side <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Hudson</a>, Adam Levine and John Krazinski, to raise funds for children living in poverty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He’s supported the arts, joining in a celebration at Los Angeles County Museum of the Arts’ 50th birthday and helping to raise more than $5 million for the museum and it’s programming.</p><p>Perhaps closest to the comedian’s heart is <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">supporting cancer patients and finding a cure</a>. Since 1993, Ferrell has consistently donated time and funds to Cancer for College, an organization <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">providing scholarships</a> to cancer survivors so they can attend college. He hosted the annual Desert Smash tennis event supporting his favorite charity and even played at five different baseball stadiums in one day to raise funds for cancer charities.</p><p>In his typical funny way, Ferrell’s consistent stripping down in movies, he says, should have a benefit other than his routine streaking. Every time Ferrell loses his clothes, he makes a donation to UNICEF.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Trisha Yearwood Raises $24K For An Animal Charity In Honor Of The Late Betty White</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Just Start Investing</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celeb Casas</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Inquisitr</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5dmrpqxo2LEqrjLZp2eqqKaua15xJqpp6tdlruledKpnKeco2K1qr%2BMpqClpJmku7R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
