It’s important to note that the driver in question was a substitute specifically designated for that particular route. In our commitment to ensuring the safety of our students, we have promptly assigned a new driver to cover the bus route for the duration of the school year.”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwxKymraddmLy2utOyZJuto2Kxs7XVnqlmrpmZsrB7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
