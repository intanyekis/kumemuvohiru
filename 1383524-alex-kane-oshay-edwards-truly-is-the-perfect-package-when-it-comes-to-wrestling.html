When asked about O’Shay Edwards debuting for the company at Never Say Never, Kane said he’s been pushing to get Edwards into the company for quite some time.</p><p>“It means the world. He’s definitely a guy I’ve been pushing for. It’s been a minute,” Alex Kane revealed. “It’s been hard. I’ve had to be on a lot of people’s tails. But I think that O’Shay Edwards is truly the total package when it comes to professional wrestling. He’s somebody I strive to be like, even though he will tell you that he’s trying to get like me, and I’m trying to get like him. That’s our dynamic.</p><p>“But yeah, I definitely think he’s a total package. The man can talk, he can wrestle, and he can cut one hell of a promo. I think he’s it. He really needs that opportunity to kind of, be showcased a little bit to really broaden those horizons. I know that he was in Ring of Honor, and that was his own thing, but from when I’ve watched, he wasn’t. He didn’t really have a chance to like really showcase the important stuff. Like yeah, we know that you can wrestle, but he doesn’t have a lot of chances to talk or cut promos and stuff like that.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-what-s-next-for-bomaye-fight-club>What’s Next For Bomaye Fight Club?</h2><p>“With [O’Shay] being in the Bomaye&nbsp;Fight Club, I’m going to try to get him as many chances to speak as I possibly can. I just want to see him win. He’s been an integral part of my career. The match that I had with him was actually the match that I actually realized like, ‘Yo, I can actually be a problem in this business.’ A problem in a good way.</p><p>“That match [with him] did so much for me, and he’s done so much for me along the way. So, just being able to have that input, who’s going to be in the Fight Club or not. And then also, going forward, trying to get him those opportunities so that he is showcased, he’s not just there. That’s what I’m looking to do as the Fight Club captain.”</p><p>When asked about the potential of The Bomaye Fight Club moving forward following MLW Never Say Never, Kane said the group has great chemistry, and he’s excited to see what’s next for them.</p><p>“I’m excited to see what they come up with as far as like how we make it work,” Alex Kane admitted. “I think me and [Mr. Thomas] have really, really good chemistry. Me and O’Shay have really good chemistry, so I’m waiting to see how Thomas and O’Shay play off each other. I think they’ll have good chemistry, and I hope that they do. We all have good chemistry, and it’s just circulating. This is going to get nuts.”</p><p>You can check out our interview with Alex Kane in the embedded video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><a href=#>Court Bauer: Alex Kane Is Special, It’s Fascinating To See His Evolution</a></p><p>What do you make of Alex Kane’s comments?
