Some tend to go for the life of the party no matter how hard they try, while others prefer that poet in the corner. While we may not date a copy of our ex, we won’t generally stray too far from our list, except for special occasions. As you may know, Jennifer Lawrence is mature for her age and can be called an old soul. She’s smart, wise, and doesn’t take part in petty drama. So it’s no surprise that she is often drawn to older friends and older men. Her most recent boyfriend was the creator of her movie Mother!, Darren Aronofsky, who was over 20 years older than her! The two ended it on good terms, and now, J-Law is on the market yet again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are rumors that she is dating Rob Kardashian, but we know better than that. More than likely, she’s good friends with him but is looking for someone quite different. She did once tell MTV, “I would just rather have somebody that has the same taste in reality TV.” This adds one thing to the list. But what’s even stranger is that she once said that she wanted a guy who wouldn’t be afraid to pass gas in front of her, which is not something that most women will say, but I guess our Jen is special. In short, she wants someone who is real and isn’t afraid to eat. Sounds like a solid dude. But who could that be? These twenty men will most likely be the ones called J-Law theirs before you can name every Hunger Games movie in order.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-a-crush-on-larry-david>She Has A Crush On Larry David</h2><p>This is the one man that Jennifer Lawrence just can’t get over as she’s told us time and time again. “I gave <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry David</a>&nbsp;my number. And he never called,” she admitted. She told Glamour that the fact that he probably isn’t talking to her because of his morals makes him even more attractive. “I love that he didn’t call me. It makes him so much hotter. When asked flat-out if she liked him later on, she said, “I’m in love with him, and I have been for a really long time.”</p><p>He may be 70, but it seems that he’s respectful, and if she’s loved him for this long, surely, he has something to offer. Looks like this is the perfect man for her. Now, if only she could get him to return her calls... Playing hard to get is really doing it for Jennifer Lawrence.</p><h2 id=she-says-she-worships-woody-allen>She Says She Worships Woody Allen</h2><p>When talking about her love for Larry David, she admitted that there was one more man that got her going, “I worship <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woody Allen</a>, but I don’t feel it the way I do for Larry David.” Now, whether that’s a compliment or not is beyond us. Woody Allen is an old soul just like Jennifer Lawrence, but as she said, he’s only her second choice. But we know if she can’t have Larry David, then Woody Allen should give her a call. If his morals are beyond hers, then we know that they could be really great friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s strange to think that the man from Annie Hall could actually age. After all, we assume actors are immortal, but the truth is that they are just like you, me, and Jennifer Lawrence. Age is only so relative though, right, Jennifer? The heart wants what the heart wants.</p><h2 id=she-gets-cozy-with-david-lettermen>She Gets Cozy With David Lettermen</h2><p>It may seem strange, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Letterman</a> is one man that young women just can’t seem to get enough of. Back in the day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Moore</a> grabbed his behind when she greeted him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Roberts</a> gave him the longest hug in history and insisted on a kiss as well, but many more have flirted with him. More recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively</a> was seen crushing on him, making so many people&nbsp;wonder what they see in him.</p><p>Jennifer herself has been on his show many times. She feels comfortable talking about anything! In 2014, she told him she wanted to “get out of here,” during an interview. She then took him by the hand and left the stage!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What they did afterward is unknown, but we’re sure nothing untoward took place. However, she seems to really be into him like the other girls, leaving us stumped as to what attracts young girls to him.</p><h2 id=she-gets-along-with-david-o-russell>She Gets Along With David O. Russell</h2><p>The director, screenwriter, and producer,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David O. Russel</a>, isn’t one that hits the headlines often. The director is still famous for many great movies including Joy and Silver Linings Playbook. According to on-set sources from E! Online, Jennifer Lawrence and David O. Russel were caught screaming at each other on set in a “heated” argument. It was supposedly method acting, but cast members were so uncomfortable that they were worried about the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two have been in countless interviews together and seem very close, so close that back in 2016, there were rumors that the two were dating. It makes sense, as J loves maturity and seems to aim high on the totem pole. David O. Russel just can’t stop casting her and isn’t afraid to say anything to the young lady. There’s no telling where their relationship will go, but we know who David’s favorite actress is. He saw a star before any of the rest of us did.</p><h2 id=she-is-close-to-bill-engvall>She Is Close To Bill Engvall</h2><p>Well, perhaps there’s one man who saw a star before even David O. Russel did. There has to be a special place in one’s heart for the man who gave you your very first job. Jennifer Lawrence’s first job was on The Bill Engvall Show as Lauren Pearson. On the show, she was his daughter, but we all know how that could have turned out. When it comes to Hollywood, we don’t ask questions.</p><p>In 2015, Bill told In Touch, “I’m so proud of Jenny, I knew from the moment we hired her that we wouldn’t have her very long. I hate this phrase, but there’s no way to describe it: She had ‘it.’” He admitted that it seemed every lady he’d had on his shoulders went on to do great things. Whether it’s as a date or a father figure, it would be nice to see a reunion with these two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-very-into-bill-murray>She Is Very Into Bill Murray</h2><p>Her entire life, Jennifer Lawrence was dying to meet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Murray</a>, and we understand that. He’s a funny guy with a dry sense of humor and doesn’t seem to care what anyone else thinks. This is something so many of us desire in a significant other. "I and the rest of the world have been a huge fan of Bill Murray for a really long time and always wanted to meet him," she told reporters at Comi-Con 2015, where they first met.</p><p>He said he was glad to meet her, but what’s really creepy is that she had continuously sent Woody Harrelson emails about Bill. Woody and Bill know each other, and she used Woody as a go-between. At least she admitted this happened mostly when she was a little out of it. But is&nbsp;that kind of love really that much different than sober love? Because in most cases, it’s more genuine than not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-gushed-over-jeff-bridges>She Gushed Over Jeff Bridges</h2><p>Another one that J-Law has admitted she likes is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Bridges,&nbsp;</a>as she loves The Big Lebowski and particularly his character, The Dude. The first time that she met him, she started to approach him but ended up getting starstruck and ran away. Can you imagine Jennifer Lawrence being starstruck? In an interview with Extra, she explained, “I’m such a huge fan. Oh, my God, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>To be fair this was in 2013 when she was nowhere near as famous as she is now. Jeff Bridges didn’t seem to know her then and made things awkward by not playing along when she questioned him. Now, I’m sure they’d get along a little better as they would both be more comfortable. And we know she’d like a second chance meeting one of her crushes. But there’s just something about Jeff Bridges that would make any of us starstruck, the man can be quite intimidating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-geeked-out-over-meeting-jack-nicholson>She Geeked Out Over Meeting Jack Nicholson</h2><p>"You look like an old girlfriend," Jack says to which Jen replies, "oh, do I look like a new one?" If there’s one man that Jennifer Lawrence has outright flirted with, it’s<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Jack Nicholson. </a>Now, Jack here is 80 years old, but it’s possible that the young J-Law would at least date him. Their meeting was both cute and creepy back in 2013. It started when he was waiting for her to finish an interview to tell her that she “did such a beautiful job” and he “loved” her in Silver Linings Playbook. She then playfully said that he was “being really rude” by interrupting her segment that was being recorded. After he left, he snuck up once again to whisper, “I’ll be waiting,” in a Shining way.</p><p>But that wasn’t the end of it, “He sent me flowers and a bottle of Cristal and a note that said, ‘Missing you already,” Lawrence told ABC News. She even hinted that the two were a thing when asked directly, “Oh...&nbsp;are we dating?,” she asked Extra TV. “Are we an item? I'm not going to say what he did or didn’t do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-intimidated-by-john-stamos>She Is Intimidated By John Stamos</h2><p>Just saying, everyone and their mother has been into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Stamos</a> at least once in their life and J-Law is no different. When asked about her obsession, she said that she stalked him at a party, staring at his behind. She admitted that she was avoiding him all night because she was afraid she’d make a fool out of herself. He thought she acting so weird that she must have been on some kind of illegal substance and asked her flat out! She told him that she wasn’t and that was just her sober self.</p><p>Later on, Stamos complained on Twitter that he missed a wonderful opportunity with the beautiful woman. If that means that he’s willing to give her another chance, then we’re all aboard. We’d all love to see John Stamos in a serious relationship because honestly, all we can see is Uncle Jesse and have been in love since the ‘80s!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-very-close-to-co-star-woody-harrelson>She Is Very Close To Co-Star Woody Harrelson</h2><p>Just look at the way he looks at her! You’ve seen how close the Hunger Games costars really are. While there may be quite an age gap, it seems the two text and email on a regular basis about daily life. They are so comfortable with each other that they can be seen invading each other’s space like two elementary school siblings. It’s like they could be caught wrestling or cuddling on the couch. After all, they have been known kill it on SNL together. There’s no doubt in our minds that they don’t love each other. But honestly, we kind of hope that their relationship doesn’t escalate, cause the love they show is too pure to mess up with a non-platonic love.</p><p>But if it does happen in due time, then we’re totally okay with it because they already love each other so much! You know they’d never want to hurt each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-gets-along-with-howard-stern-on-his-show>She Gets Along With Howard Stern On His Show</h2><p>If you’ve never seen Jennifer Lawrence get comfortable then you’re not really a fan at all. But if you’ve never seen her completely let go then you haven’t seen her relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern.</a> You see, Howard Stern is one man who has no filter. It seems that J-Law can relate to this as when she’s on his show, she’ll say anything. They talk about things that most 20-some-year-olds wouldn’t dream of talking about with a 60-some-year-old. She also lets loose and will no longer use PG language as is required on other talk shows.</p><p>In short, we wouldn’t be surprised to see these two friends take their relationship to the next level for a time. They both lack a filter, as stated, and prefer to get real, no matter how bad it makes them look. And hey, Jennifer Lawrence could make a great judge on a reality TV show, and really needs her own talk show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-went-to-guy-oseary-s-party>She Went To Guy Oseary's Party</h2><p>Now, if there’s one thing that will bring you closer to someone, it’s puking on their porch. But back in 2014, Jennifer Lawrence was invited to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Oseary’s</a> big Oscar after party. She told Seth Meyers about this one and even admitted that she blamed her friend, Laura, who was a bad influence on her. It seemed the friend encouraged her to&nbsp;party too much until she eventually couldn’t take it, letting it out on Guy’s porch. Nice one, J. Miley Cyrus even saw her and told her to “get it together!" Now, that’s a low blow.</p><p>But the thing was, she was so proud to be invited to Guy’s party, and it seems he wasn’t offended that she vomited all over his deck. Fast-forward four years, and she’s still an attendee! Only this time, she’s keeping it together, likely helping newcomers keep the porch clean. It’s a dirty job, but somebody’s got to do it.</p><h2 id=tim-burton-is-one-of-jen-s-favorite-people-in-hollywood>Tim Burton Is One Of Jen's Favorite People In Hollywood</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Burton</a> is one of Jennifer Lawrence’s favorite directors and producers. She loves his movies, and frankly, is hurt that he hasn’t cast her yet. She&nbsp;said if they were dating then, no doubt, she’d get cast. When he was dating Helena Bonham Carter, she landed a role in just about every movie he made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She once said that her and Emma Stone were talking once, and it made her wonder what her most devastating audition was. The one role that really shook her was for Tim Burton’s,&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland. “That one devastated me,” she explained. It doesn’t surprise us that she’s into the eccentric, creepy&nbsp;jack-of-all-film-trades. Jennifer Lawrence may have had times in the past where she’s gotten antsy, but these days, she’s about as brave as they come. He’d be a doll for him to put into his shows and who knows, maybe he’ll finally find someone more…permanent.</p><h2 id=eric-warren-singer-is-also-one-of-david-o-russel-s-favorites>Eric Warren Singer Is Also One Of David O. Russel's Favorites</h2><p>There’s something about J-Law that is attracted to the big man on the stage. As in, she hates people most of the time and tends to lean toward directors and… screenwriters. Actors are overrated anyway. That’s why her and Eric Warren Singer, screenwriter for Red Sparrow, could be a legit couple. The genius behind American Hustle is likely soon to be one of the biggest screenwriters in the industry. Now, with a man that powerful complimenting Jennifer Lawrence on her performances, that’s saying something. He’s even had her in two of his movies thus far! Red Sparrow already has&nbsp;decent&nbsp;reviews in the few weeks it’s been out.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a friend of David O. Russel, we’re anxious to see if either one of them end up with Lawrence after working with her for so long. As long as she doesn’t go for both of them one right after the other then we’re good.</p><h2 id=she-is-very-comfortable-around-adam-sandler>She Is Very Comfortable Around Adam Sandler</h2><p>This friendship isn’t a surprise, but what if it went further? J-Law and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler </a>have been pretty&nbsp;close pals for quite a while. They have many photos together and were brilliant in Actors on Actors together. We know that all Jennifer wants is to feel comfortable with a man, and she seemed pretty comfortable with him. She says that he’s her favorite comic actor, which must have been amazing for Sandler to hear.</p><p>If you’d like to watch their sketch, then go ahead, but beware, the kids should not be around. They may not get too inappropriate, but they sound like two teenage boys in a locker room. While their relationship seems more like siblings than partners, they do say that the best couples start out as best friends. That would make them the perfect couple. They have so much in common and love hanging out, what more could you ask for?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jean-dujardin-held-her-dress-for-her-at-the-oscars>Jean Dujardin Held Her Dress For Her At The Oscars</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean Dujardin</a> is a French actor, comedian, and director who is an old friend of J-Law’s. He’s famous for The Wolf of Wall Street and The Artist, but also for being the perfect gentleman. Back in 2013, he presented J-Law her Oscar award and shared a sweet photo together. But even better than that, he held her dress while she walked so she wouldn’t fall…again. She was known for being prone to trips at the time and he was kind enough to hold her train for her! She must have felt pretty special. Like Prince Charming coming to the rescue, he was there for her. It didn’t seem like he did so to make him look good either. More so, to make her comfortable!</p><p>Is it his French heritage, upbringing, or his time spent in the spotlight? We’re not sure, but something about him charming J-Law is quite the site. After all, it takes a lot to woo this girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-are-rumours-about-her-and-brad-pitt>There Are Rumours About Her And Brad Pitt</h2><p>This one is no shocker for two reasons— he and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a> just split and there’s already an intense rumor that the two are dating. The thing is, she refuses to deny that they are. She met him once in 2013. During that interview with Seth, she said that he smelled like sandalwood when she met him at the party and it was amazing!</p><p>Reportedly, she says she’s not in a huge hurry to debunk the rumors that they are dating. So either that means that she likes him or that they are secretly seeing each other. Now it may seem like Pitt is 25, but he has aged, you know. Pitt is already 54, making him exactly twice as old as Lawrence! Now that is quite the age gap. Now, whether she’d be great with his kids is another story as we’re not sure about her interaction with children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andy-cohen-made-her-cry-tears-of-joy>Andy Cohen Made Her Cry Tears Of Joy</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Cohen</a> has been a friend of J-Law’s for quite some time now. She admitted that he helped her with her breakup with Darren by giving her the surprise of her dreams! Earlier in the year, she told Oprah that Luann Lesseps, Bethenny Frankel and the&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, Scott Disick, were the three people — living or gone&nbsp;— she’d most want to have at a dinner party. Well, hearing this, Andy made her dreams come true.</p><p>She enjoyed the surprise so much that she said she thought she was going to cry! While Disick couldn’t make it, the two ladies were happy to help Cohen make the young star’s dreams come true. He swept her off her feet, which is hard to do to a celebrity who can pretty much have whatever they want, whenever they want. Looks like he’s a step ahead of the other guys now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-warned-her-to-stay-away-from-scott-disick>Kourtney Warned Her To Stay Away From Scott Disick</h2><p>You already know that she likes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Disick</a> because, well, he was one of her dream team members that she wanted to have a dinner party with. But since she still didn’t get to meet him, she was given a cardboard cutout of him! Now, that’s dedication to a star when you’ll love a fathead of them. While there are only eight years between the two of them, it still is a bit of a gap for your average young woman. If she were a teen, then we’d be worried.</p><p>However, she’s not and she’s serious about her admiration but so is Kourtney Kardashian. According to The Hollywood Gossip, the Kardashian warned J-Law to “keep her paws off,” but then again, it could just be gossip. That said, Jennifer Lawrence didn’t take part in the gossip and like we said, is serious about that cutout, but would prefer the real thing.</p><h2 id=she-and-bradley-cooper-are-very-close-friends>She And Bradley Cooper Are Very Close Friends</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley Cooper</a> and Jennifer Lawrence have no choice but to be friends. The two are like Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler these days. After Silver Linings Playbook, they were shipped more than Amazon packages. But when did we assume that they really had a thing for each other? Bradley says that it could, “never be like that with her,” but J hints something entirely different. They’ve now worked together four times and Cooper himself even says he sees that they have on-screen chemistry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But I’d say J says it better. She admitted that Cooper was a better kisser than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam Hemsworth</a>. That he was, in fact, a “fantastic kisser,” despite their platonic relationship. Now wouldn’t it be so strange to kiss all of these guys like you meant it and see how good they were at it before walking away?
