The low-key romance started shortly after Williams confirmed her split from ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Ricky Van Veen</strong></a> in June 2019. The <a href=#>former couple called it quits</a> after nearly four years of marriage.</p><p>“With mutual love and respect, we have made the decision to separate as a couple,” they said in a joint statement in June 2019. “We are grateful for the friendship that we have and will continue to have.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Allison-Williams-and-Alexander-Dreymon-Make-Their-Red-Carpet-Debut-After-3-Years-of-Dating-884.jpg><p>While the <a href=#>SAG nominee</a> moved on with the American Horror Story: Coven actor, the CollegeHumor cofounder, 41, moved on with <strong>Caroline Kassie</strong>.

You’re never ready. I have a lot of questions: How do I get to a place in my career where I can go be a mom for a little while and then come back and be a mom and an actress at the same time?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJyewLC6jLCgpaSZlrq0ecClnLGZnpmys3nDq5yypZ%2Bjeq6typ5kq52UYrCivs%2Beq2aclZfCtXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
