He screenshotted a publication covering his reaction to Floyd and continued to send shots at “Pretty Boy Floyd.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was chilling till this guy come around try to defend sexual <a href=# id=auto-tag_assault data-tag=assault>assault</a>, even saying if it was his daughter it would be her choice&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>@bransoncognac</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>@lecheminduroi</a>,” he added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Mayweather’s comments transpired during an interview with The Pivot Podcast on Tuesday (Feb. 20). The former boxer opened up about Diddy seemingly unprovoked. He asserted that he didn’t have an opinion on it because “it’s none of my business.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Mistakes happen,” the Money Team founder expressed. “And I can’t say if it is or if it’s not a mistake, but things happen in life. And P. Diddy business is P. Diddy business. It’s not my job or anyone else’s job to go on the internet and stomp him and kick a man when he’s down. My take on it is it’s not my business. I don’t think it’s right at all and I don’t condone it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Even if that happened to my daughter, I would be hurt, but that’s the choice that my daughter made,” he added. “So, I don’t wanna kick nobody while they’re down.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for Diddy, Combs has been gearing up to fight a lawsuit that alleges he gang-raped a 17-year-old girl in 2003. The disgraced mogul recently hired Ghislaine Maxwell‘s lawyer<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;to fight the case</a>. According to legal affairs journalist Meghann Cuniff, Combs<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;called in Bobbi Sternheim for the case.&nbsp;</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Then, on Wednesday (Feb. 21), the Bad Boy Records founder spoke out against the suit. He refferred to the lawsuit as “fictional” and “unconstitutional” in his first legal response.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He never participated in, witnessed, or was or is presently aware of any misconduct, sexual or otherwise, relating to plaintiff in any circumstance whatsoever,” his attorneys said in federal court.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">His team also argued that the suit arrived late, giving Sean Combs no time to properly defend himself in court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX2p9bq%2FEp6tmnpykxqV5zJqwsJ2RqbWmvoydoJ2cqWKwsLnMnqWtq11mf3SAl25qcm5hZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
