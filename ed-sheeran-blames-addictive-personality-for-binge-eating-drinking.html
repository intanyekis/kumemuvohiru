He released his debut album + in 2011, which produced four top ten singles, including "The A Team," "You Need Me, I Don't Need You," "Lego House" and "Drunk."</p><p>Sheeran spent 2015 on the road as part of his x World Tour. He says a bad diet, binge drinking and lack of exercise severely impacted his well-being. The British singer recalls he would drink all night, sleep all day and never see sunlight. He admits that in the beginning, it was fun living the rock and roll lifestyle but that it eventually took its toll.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ed Sheeran Out-Earns Beyoncé & Taylor Swift In Touring For 2018</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The endless cycle of unhealthy behavior led him to question his existence. Sheeran blames his descent on having "a very, very addictive personality." He likened himself to <a href=#>Elton John</a>, whose biography he’s reading, in that he would binge on food and alcohol, often eating several desserts until he threw up.</p><p>The “Perfect” singer says the experience left him sad and depressed. Even though his abuse of sugar and alcohol had short-term rewards, he recognizes that he struggled with his weight gain. At one point, his entourage referred to him as Two Dinner Teddy because he would order two meals.</p><p>Now, he says he has found his way back by practicing moderation and exercising. His wife, Cherry Seaborn, has also had a tremendous influence on him. He followed her lead when it came to going out running, eating balanced meals and drinking in moderation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheeran, who has released four studio albums, has gone on to amass a fortune of $160 million. He has won four <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a>, including Song of the Year in 2016 for "Thinking Out Loud", five Brit Awards, including British Male Solo Artist in 2015, and six Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist in 2018.
