After going through so much back and forth, Audrina and Corey divorced in 2018.</p><p>Fans are wondering what Corey Bohan has been up to since his divorce and how he gets to still stay relevant in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=who-is-corey-bohan>Who Is Corey Bohan?</h2><p>Corey Bohan is of Australian descent. He was born on January 15th, 1982 in Queensland, Australia. Corey’s childhood information is out of reach at the moment since he decided to keep that part of his life out of the public eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corey-bohan.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides that, Corey is a biker and an actor.

At first, it consumed me and took my focus off of my bike, but really, after experiencing the red carpet events, parties, and the people, in the end, it made my love for BMX stronger and my focus more powerful.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corey-bohan-png1.png><p>In 2004, during an interview with The BMX Network, when Corey was just 24 years old, he was asked if he felt weird making a living riding a BMX bike. Corey’s response was, “Not so much weird but lucky I think. It’s pretty cool to look at your bike and see what it has done for me and the places I have taken it. It's small and the general public don’t understand how much fun it can be. I love the death stairs from businessmen while riding the street or something, if only they knew how much fun us bmxers are having. As Mr. T would say ‘I pity the fool’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Corey’s love for biking pretty much started at a very early age in life for him and it seems like up until now, that love hasn’t ceased.</p><h2 id=corey-bohan-and-audrina-patridge-rsquo-s-relationship-timeline>Corey Bohan And Audrina Patridge’s Relationship Timeline</h2><p>Corey and Audrina Patridge are not the first <a href=#>celebrity couple to ever have an on-and-off relationship</a>, and they won’t be the last either.</p><p>They started dating in 2008.

I was going through a divorce, and I was moving. There were times when I broke down on camera because I couldn’t hold it together. But my Hills family was so supportive and loving. They were there for me."</p><p>Also, Audrina added by equalizing divorce to mourning a death. She said, "Divorce is like mourning a death. You’re ending a chapter in your life. And when you have a child in the mix, it makes things harder. Then, to add in publicity and people judging you … makes it a million times worse.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually, <a href=#>Audrina and Corey's troubling divorce</a> was finalized in December 2018.

According to TMZ, in 2020,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Corey claimed that the COVID-19 lockdown caused him to be jobless</a> hence he needed child support.</p><p>TMZ and Blast were able to obtain the legal documents about this matter that was filed in Orange County Superior Court by Corey Bohan.</p><p>In the document, Corey said that he previously worked as a bartender, but he lost his job once the lockdown began. He added that since Audrina still makes a lot of money, their daughter Kirra should be able to live comfortably in both households. "I do not receive spousal support or child support from Petitioner, although she earns a significantly higher income than me. It is in the best interest of Kirra for the Court to establish a child support order as Petitioner earns a significantly higher income than Respondent." Corey said in the filing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="18 Stunning Pics Of The Hills Audrina Patridge">18 Stunning Pics Of The Hills Audrina Patridge</a></span></p><p>Fast-forward to 2021, according to Daily Mail, Corey, and Audrina's custody agreement was finalized.
