The famous teenager, who’s soon going to turn 18, was photographed during a solo walk in New York, where she’s been raised by her mom <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a> since divorcing <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> in 2012.</p><p>The teen was dressed casually in a floral dress with dark tights and sneakers. Overtop, she layered a large denim jacket and an oversized shoulder bag. Suri didn’t seem bothered by the paparazzi, holding an open bag of pretzels and keeping herself distracted by her phone as she made her way through the streets.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-06t102418-146.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Are Tom Cruise And Nicole Kidman's Adopted Kids Doing Today?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The media is always reporting on Nicole Kidman's kids, and Tom Cruise's kids, but why do we so rarely hear about the pair's adopted kids?</span><h2 id=suri-cruise-looked-all-grown-up-in-new-photos>Suri Cruise Looked All Grown Up In New Photos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/katie-holmes-spends-time-with-daughter-suri-as-jamie-foxx-tries-to-win-her-back-after-health-scare.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Suri is finishing her final year of high school and is expected to start college later this year. Various reports claim the teen is anxious to stay in NYC, and while she’s shown an interest in acting (like <a href=#>nailing the starring role in her school’s play</a>), she’s apparently interested in studying fashion.</p><p>There’s been a lot of attention around Suri and her family, as Tom Cruise’s child support will supposedly come to an end as she turns 18. One report claimed <a href=#>Katie was anxious to secure new work</a> as she’ll be experiencing a big loss of income when the child support ends. She was allegedly receiving around $40,000 per month from her ex.</p><p>“For years, Katie’s enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, thanks to Tom’s consistent support,” a source told In Touch. “But as their child nears adulthood, both mother and daughter are facing an uncertain future. It’s a terrifying prospect — going from an amazing standard of living to a question mark overnight!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-rsquo-s-lawyer-responded-to-the-child-support-speculation>Katie’s Lawyer Responded To The Child Support Speculation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/untitled-design-3-5.jpg><p>Katie supposedly signed an NDA following her divorce from Tom, which rumors have suggested was fueled by his controversial Scientology believes. Now that the NDA is reportedly expiring, the source claims Katie is interested in writing a memoir to share her side of the story.</p><p>“She’s actively looking for roles and is eager to throw herself back into the industry full-time,” the insider claimed. “And don’t forget the non-disclosure agreement she signed — it’s set to expire, too. If things get tough, Katie could cash in by penning a tell-all book!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:55</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_how-old-is-tom-cruise-during-his-most-dangerous-stunts_bk_a1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Old Is Tom Cruise During His Most Dangerous Stunts?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tom Cruise's dangerous stunts make his action movies exciting for fans to watch, but his age during the stunts make them really impressive.</span><p>Interestingly, the report and subsequent speculation was enough to make Katie respond, even though she’s known for keeping silent on her personal life. The Dawson’s Creek actress <a href=#>simply released a statement via her lawyer</a> denying the recent reports.</p><p>"The story is riddled with falsehoods. One would hope there would be more newsworthy items to cover, and publications would avoid reporting as 'facts' claims from anonymous sources peddling such obvious misrepresentations,” her attorney Jonathan W. Wolfe told the media.</p><p>Tom – who’s notoriously private about his personal life – hasn’t addressed Suri in interviews in years. However, it’s been reported that the Mission: Impossible actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still plans to financially support Suri</a> when she attends college, though he’ll apparently have no say in where or what she studies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrqqZYrCzwcisnGaqkaeybq3PqZyaqpGjsKZ5wKagnWWblsGqsYyhpqWllah6rrvNnrBmqKKkr62xzKxkraedqHqktMilm2arpaW9sL7TZpynnKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
