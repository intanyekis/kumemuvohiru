In the following decades, the Chouinards owned and operated Patagonia as a private, for-profit company that specializes in outdoor gear and apparel. That all changed last month when the family transferred ownership of Patagonia's intellectual property to two entities: the Holdfast Collective and Patagonia Purpose Trust."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to<a href=#> the New York Time</a>s, all of the company’s voting stock (approximately 2 percent of the total) will go into the latter entity, while the remaining 98 percent will go into the Holdfast Collective. The Chouinards will oversee the PPT along with advisers. The trust will ensure the company doesn’t stray from its core values and longstanding commitment to sustainable practices.</p><p>“Hey, friends, we just gave our company to planet Earth. OK, it’s more nuanced than that, but we’re closed today to celebrate this new plan to save our one and only home.

The Times reports that Chouinard and his wife did not receive any tax benefits for moving their manufacturing operations overseas.</p><p>“Patagonia is an example of what major corporations actually have the power to do — if they decided to change the word instead of seek bottom line returns. However, in America, corporations usually use their wealth to evade prosecutions and to ruin lives:”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Earth is now our only shareholder,” Chouinard wrote in his announcement. He went on to add, “While we’re doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it’s not enough. We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company’s values intact.”</p><p>“This is a real game-changer, raising the bar on what a socially conscious business can look like.”</p><p>Yvon also posted a letter on Patagonia's official website.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=earth-is-now-our-only-shareholder><strong>“Earth is now our only shareholder.”</strong></h3><p>“If we have any hope of a thriving planet—much less a business—it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have.&nbsp;This is what we can do.”</p><p><strong>By <a href=#>Yvon Chouinard</a></strong></p><p>“I never wanted to be a businessman. I started as a craftsman, making climbing gear for my friends and myself, then got into apparel. As we began to witness the extent of global warming and ecological destruction, and our own contribution to it, Patagonia committed to using our company to change the way business was done. If we could do the right thing while making enough to pay the bills, we could influence customers and other businesses, and maybe change the system along the way.</p><p>We started with our products, using materials that caused less harm to the environment. We gave away 1% of sales each year. We became a certified B Corp and a California benefit corporation, writing our values into our corporate charter so they would be preserved. More recently, in 2018, we changed the company’s purpose to: We’re in business to save our home planet.</p><p>While we’re doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it’s not enough.
