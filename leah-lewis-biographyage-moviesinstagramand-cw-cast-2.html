Leah Lewis (The CW’s Charmed) will co-star in the pilot, from Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage’s Fake Empire and CBS TV Studios, which has tapped Larry Teng (the CW’s Supergirl) as director and Melinda Hsu Taylor (The Ce’s The Vampire Diaries) as executive producer/showrunner.<br>Written/executive produced by Noga Landau, Schwartz and Savage, the untitled Nancy Drew project centers on 18-year-old Nancy Drew (McMann) and is set in the summer after her high school graduation.

When Nancy ends up a suspect in a murder, it rekindles her love for detective work, even though the clues lead her to believe that a long-dead local girl may be the killer.</p><p>Lewis plays George, a tough, tattooed girl from the wrong side of the tracks who felt personally wronged by Nancy in high school. George now finds herself a suspect in the killing along with her former nemesis, forcing her to team up with Nancy to track the culprit and clear their names… and it just may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.<br>This marks the first pilot directing gig for veteran episodic director Teng who has served as co-executive producer/director on the CW’s Supergirl, TNT’s the Animal Kingdom and NBC/CBS’ Medium. He also has helmed multiple episodes of The Walking Dead, The Good Doctor, S.W.A.T., Criminal Minds, Elementary and Lethal Weapon.
