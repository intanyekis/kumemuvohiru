Well, we have the answer: <strong>yes</strong>. Both Mila Kunis and Demi Moore attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. Demi Moore attended in the 1970s, and Mila Kunis in the late 1990s. So, the pair have something in common <a href=#>besides a romantic connection to Ashton Kutcher</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Does Demi Moore’s Relationship With Ashton Kutcher Stand Today?</a></span></p><p>However, the two women had radically different high school experiences. Kunis was already a working actress when she attended Fairfax, whereas Moore had a very different and much more tragic childhood, although Kunis’s life was not free of struggle either. Both actresses went through major life changes as they found their way to Fairfax High. Moore left her home after a traumatizing personal tragedy and Kunis immigrated with her family to the United States when she was incredibly young. This is what we know about the high school experiences of these two actresses.</p><h2 id=demi-moore-rsquo-s-family-moved-around-a-lot-before-settling-in-la><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Demi Moore’s Family Moved Around A Lot Before Settling In LA</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Demi Moore is originally from New Mexico but she, her mother, and stepfather moved around the country quite a bit before settling in Los Angeles. When she was very young, Moore’s real father left the family, and years later her stepfather passed away, leaving only Moore and her mother. The two had a very strained relationship. But once they settled in Los Angeles, Moore began classes at Fairfax High in 1976.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis-was-already-acting-when-she-started-high-school><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mila Kunis Was Already Acting When She Started High School</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mila Kunis’ family also made a major move when they ended up in Los Angeles. Mila Kunis was born in the former Soviet Union and her family decided to leave for the states just a few years before the nation’s fall. By the time she was 14, she <a href=#>had already begun to act </a>on That 70s Show <a href=#>after she lied to producers about her age</a>. She originally attended <a href=#>Los Angeles Center For Enriched Studies</a>, but the school would not work with her acting schedule. She transferred to Fairfax High as a sophomore.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Nasty Way Mila Kunis Lost 20-Pounds For 'Black Swan'</a></span></p><h2 id=demi-moore-left-school-her-junior-year><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Demi Moore Left School Her Junior Year</span></h2><p>Demi Moore is not technically an alumnus of the school because she did not graduate. Demi Moore <a href=#>dropped out when she was 16</a> and was living on her own by the time she was 17. Soon after she left home, she began modeling thanks to encouragement from her friends, which helped her to eventually find legitimate roles as an actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mila-kunis-graduated-in-2001><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mila Kunis Graduated In 2001</span></h2><p>While Demi Moore dropped out of Fairfax High when she was only a junior, Mila Kunis stayed in school all four years, and she graduated in 2001 at a time when That 70s Show was still riding high in the ratings. This was also around the same time when Mila Kunis took over for Lacey Chabert as the voice of Meg Griffin on Family Guy. Mila Kunis briefly attended UCLA after high school, but her college tenure never quite worked out as well as her acting did.</p><h2 id=demi-moore-left-home-when-she-was-only-16><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Demi Moore Left Home When She Was Only 16</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Demi Moore’s high school experience was buried in tragedy. Not only did Moore drop out and leave home before she was legally an adult, she left home because of horrific circumstances. According to Moore, <a href=#>she was raped when she was 16</a> by a much older man, and her rapist claimed that her mother had been paid to allow him to hurt her. Moore admits she has no idea if the last part is true or not, but one can understand why she couldn’t abide in that home or school any longer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is When Demi Moore's Face Started To Change</a></span></p><h2 id=mila-kunis-rsquo-s-family-gave-up-everything-to-bring-them-to-the-states><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mila Kunis’s Family Gave Up Everything To Bring Them To The States</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As mentioned above, Mila Kunis’ family <a href=#>immigrated to the United States near the end of the U.S.S.R.’s reign</a>, but what is even more impressive is they left the nation from a position of privilege. Her family was not struggling in the Soviet Union, on the contrary in fact. Her mother <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was a successful physics teacher</a> and her father <a href=#>a prominent mechanical engineer</a>, the family was very well off and only decided to leave when the government under then-Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev was beginning to struggle with a floundering economy.</p><h2 id=they-are-not-the-only-famous-alums><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Are Not The Only Famous Alums</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both are notable actresses who have given the world a variety of classic performances, but the two are far from the only famous people to have come from <a href=#>Fairfax Highschool</a>, other notable alums are David Arquette, Carol Lombard, Mickey Rooney, Tito Jackson, Anthony Keidess, James Ellroy, and Jack Kemp to list just a few. The school was also the place where the original members of bands like Guns and Roses and Red Hot Chili Peppers met. This is only a fraction of the school’s most notable alumni. It seems that Fairfax High has a lot to be proud of with such an impressive track record of entertainers who once graced their halls.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Did Jack Black Actually Have A Crush On His Wife In High School?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmbKutYympqiqlWKur7CMpqClmV2gwq%2B10mapnpmcocZus85mq6hlpJ2ybr%2FAppxmoJmctW6%2FwqGmqKRf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
