Kirk Rush.</p><p>Then-Chief Lee allegedly injured Sgt. Rush while demonstrating a neck restraint in a briefing room. Sgt. Rush claims the maneuver was done incorrectly, and Lee intentionally tried to "physically dominate" him in front of other officers after Rush disagreed with Lee's new direction for the BPD K9 unit.</p><p>Sgt. Rush says he received injuries to his neck requiring medical attention following Lee's chokehold.</p><p>Former Chief Lee was suing Rush and other unnamed defendants for what Lee referred to as a "campaign to remove him as police chief." The time during and following Chief Lee's tenure sparked several lawsuits, including former Director of Police Accountability Jesus Jara.</p><p>Jara is suing the City of Boise for wrongful termination, alleging he was retaliated against for investigating complaints against Lee, even though information uncovered by Boise Dev details internal memos from Jara saying he knew some of the complaints against Lee were false but did not take action against the officers who filed the reports.</p><p>Jara also wrote a memo detailing how he felt Former Chief Lee should be placed on paid leave while the complaints from Rush and others were investigated.</p><p>Idaho State Police investigated Lee, but he was not charged with anything. The prosecutor from Northern Idaho who reviewed the investigation said it was "a close call." Lee was never placed on leave until he was asked to step down by Mayor McLean.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlwvsSppqusXZu8s7nEq2Sbp5mosm68zqWgnJ1dmLWqscVmqbKZnmK5prGMnamoqKNiuaquxKVkrKSRo7GmvoylmLCrpZ7Bbq3GmqCnq6Ris6a4y6iuZqeWm7aksdGs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
