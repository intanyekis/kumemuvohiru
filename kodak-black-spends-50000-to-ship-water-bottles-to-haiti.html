In 2018, Kodak revealed he’s building a school in Haiti.</p><p>" <a href=#>I got my grandma a mansion in Haiti</a> ," he stated on Instagram. "I feel like we still be going [through] slavery... out of all the times I give back or donate in [any way], I never upload of broadcast it but I am happy to say I am building a school in Haiti as well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year, he <a href=#>donated enough money to Florida’s Paradise Children</a> to buy Christmas gifts for 150 local children. He also gave $5,000 to go towards the charitable organization’s holiday party.</p><p>He’s also been known to reach out individually to help those in need. In 2018, he gave $2,500 to the family of Terrence Carraway, a South Carolina police office who was killed while on-duty.</p><p>The following year, the rapper gave $12,500 to Paige Cook, who was trying to raise enough fund to provide notebooks and pencils to over 7,000 students in her Texas district, which was known for being low-income. His donation helped Paige buy over 40,000 pencils for local students.</p><p>Also in 2019, Kodak offered to pay the funeral expenses of Kendrick Ray Castillo, who was shot dead in an altercation, though Kendrick’s family apparently didn’t respond to the offer. Additionally, following the death of his friend XXXTenacion, Kodak gave $50,000 to the late rapper’s son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly Kodak isn’t afraid to share his wealth, but he’s only <a href=#>worth a reported $600,000</a>, which pales in comparison to the fortunes of many of today’s mainstream rappers. Take Kanye West, who’s apparently worth $2 billion, but was recently <a href=#>called out for failing to follow through</a> with his promises to help a Los Angeles homeless shelter.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion Is Suing Her Record Label For $1 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Hot New Hip Hop</a>, <a href=#>Hot New Hip Hop</a>, <a href=#>Wealthy Gorilla</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4sLDApGSbpJGYuG6%2Fz56lnatdan1xfI9mq6hlo522sXnWmqueql2XvLXAy56qZqyfYrWitdOiZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
