Sometimes, these places all look the same, and their menus aren't all that appealing or interesting. There are some stars who do things a bit differently, though. <a href=#>YouTube star MrBeast sold burgers</a> through ghost kitchens, which helped the brand stand out from sit-down fast food places.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Russell Brand</strong></a> is another celebrity who marches to the beat of his own drummer. If he's going to open a restaurant or coffee shop, it's definitely going to do something more than just serve food. In 2015, the actor and podcaster opened Trew Era Cafe. Here's whether the cafe is still open.</p><h2 id=when-did-russell-brand-open-trew-era-cafe>When Did Russell Brand Open Trew Era Cafe?</h2><p><a href=#>Russell Brand is known for controversial interviews</a>, but people might not even know that he started a cafe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trew Era Cafe has an interesting backstory</a>. According to The Evening Standard, Russell Brand opened Trew Era Cafe in March 2015. From the very start, the actor tried to do something good and helpful. The cafe's existence proves his devotion to causes that he believes in, including affordable housing and recovery from addiction.</p><p>In 2014, The Guardian reported that several people living in an East London housing project called New Era estate were in danger of being forced to leave their homes. Westbrook Partners bought the building and wanted to turn it into something else. Brand lent his voice to the cause.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russell-brand.jpg><p>When Brand decided to open Trews Era Cafe, he chose the New Era estate area. The Evening Standard reported that he decided that people in addiction recovery would be employees of the cafe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Russell Brand Was Left Confused Over The Request Donald Trump Made When They Privately Met At Trump Tower</a></span></p><p>Trews Era Cafe is unique in another way: Brand decided to use any money that he made from "Revolution," his 2014 book, to fund the restaurant.</p><p>The Evening Standard reported that when the cafe opened, Brand made a passionate speech. He explained his vision for the cafe and talked about the social and political ideals that he wanted the place to represent. He said "it is not a charity, it is a new business model."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russell-brand-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brand also said, "It is a model that is not for profit, a fully self-supporting, new economic enterprise. We will start more and more of these social enterprises, eventually we will trade with one another in our own currency. We are going to create our own systems, our own federations, our own currencies, our own authorities."</p><h2 id=is-russell-brand-39-s-trew-era-cafe-closed>Is Russell Brand's Trew Era Cafe Closed?</h2><p>It doesn't seem that Russell Brand intended to keep running Trew Era Cafe. In 2016, Russell Brand asked an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">organization to run Trew Era Cafe</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trew-era-cafe.jpg><p>According to The BBC, he put Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPT) in charge of the cafe. It was a great idea since the organization's London Recovery Hub building is nearby. The members of the organization were really happy about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>7 Times Russell Brand Dissed His Interviewer On Live TV</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, though, it seems that as of 2020, Trew Era Cafe closed down. The official Instagram account's bio reads "Closed but still sending love." There haven't been any new Instagram posts since November 2019.</p><p>While there are a few Instagram comments from customers wondering what happened to the cafe, it doesn't seem that RAPT ever commented on why they closed it down. It's a shame as it seemed like a really nice community. Trews Eras Cafe hosted events and people could also attend yoga classes regularly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trew-era-cafe-baked-goods.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Trew Era Cafe closed, it was a popular place, and people loved the food. Daily menu items included avocado toast with eggs, sandwiches, salads, and vegan baked goods. According to reviews on Happycow.net, people appreciated that they could enjoy a vegan meal that was more interesting than what they could normally find.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Russell Brand's Interview On The View Took An Emotional Twist After Whoopi Goldberg Brought Up His Past Issues</a></span></p><p>One customer wrote, "It's great for vegans as they offer a lot more than just soya milk. They have a vast selection of plant based milks to choose from, and a range of breakfast options. Porridge, Granola toast etc..I normally go for lunch and have the Vegan toasties, which I have to say is out of this world. It comes with a generous side salad garnish, with optional red onions or pesto. There is normally at least one other vegan option on the menu which will be a daily special."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another customer shared that they love the message of the cafe. They said, "What I like best about this place, however, is not the food but the activist hub atmosphere and staff running the show. They are all in abstinence based recovery and use the cafe as a means to empower themselves and find a social and political outlet. The effect is personal, homemade, invigorating and authentic."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russell-brand-2.jpg><p>It's sad to hear that Trew Era Cafe is no longer operating because it's clear that Russell Brand cared so much about it. According to The8percent.com, the actor became sober in 2007. He started his YouTube Channel The Trews: True News with Russell Brand in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many sources have reported that Brand decided to call his cafe Trew Era Cafe because of his YouTube videos. It seems that opening the cafe was part of his journey, and he hoped to create something meaningful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-russell-brand-s-non-profit-coffee-house-trew-era-cafe-shut-down_.jpg><p>In 2018, Russell Brand was interviewed by The Los Angeles Times and he talked about how important it is to find other people who are also in recovery. He said, "Inevitably, when reason wanes, when the spiritual experience wanes, being part of a community lets you remind one another.</p><p>Addicts yearn for some sense of connection that makes them feel more healed, more whole, more happy. Sharing your story with another addict, as I did in my recovery, proved vital."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Trew Era Cafe was open, it was a safe space for people to connect with one another, whether they were grabbing a coffee and pastry or attending one of the events. It's very sad to hear that Trew Era Cafe closed down and that people aren't able to spend time at this special place anymore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdp8K0v8Slo2aaopa7pb%2BMp6anZaCnvKe102aaqJ6WmrJutM6uqp5lpKeyuHnEq5hmm5Gbsm6%2Fx66rZpyfrLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
