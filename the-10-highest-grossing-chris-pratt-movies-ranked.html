The Minnesota native is extremely likeable, very funny and has appeared in some of the most watched movies (The Lego Movie, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Infinity War etc) and television shows (Everwood, The O.C., Parks and Recreation etc.,) of the new millennium. He's also&nbsp;starring in both Jurassic World: Dominion and&nbsp;<a href=#>Thor: Love and Thunder</a>&nbsp;this summer, which will undoubtedly increase his popularity even more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of his movies have grossed a lot of money - we're talking hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars - and we're going to list the ten highest-grossing ones for you.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Guardian Of The Galaxy: How Chris Pratt Became A Hollywood Star</a></span></p><h2 id=avengers-endgame-2019>Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h2><p>Avengers: Endgame is, by some distance, the highest-grossing movie in which Chris Pratt has appeared. Now, granted, his appearance in the movie is barely more than a cameo - but he's in it, so it counts!</p><p>In the movie, the surviving members of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Avengers and their allies</a>&nbsp;try to undo the devastation caused by <a href=#>the Mad Titan Thanos</a> in Avengers: Infinity War i.e. the erasing of half of all life in the universe (which included Pratt's Star-Lord, hence his absence for the majority of this movie).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It grossed an astonishing $2.798 billion, which temporarily made it the highest-grossing movie of all time (before a Chinese re-release of <a href=#>the brilliant&nbsp;Avatar</a> saw it reclaim top spot).</p><h2 id=avengers-infinity-war-2018>Avengers: Infinity War (2018)</h2><p>Next up is the aforementioned Avengers: Infinity War, which sees Pratt's Star-Lord in a much more prominent role, as&nbsp;the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy and their allies try (and fail) to&nbsp;stop Thanos from collecting&nbsp;all six Infinity Stones in his quest to&nbsp;erase&nbsp;half of the universe's sentient life.</p><p>Even though it grossed&nbsp;over $700 million less than Avengers: Endgame&nbsp;did,&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War still raked in a hugely impressive $2.048 billion at the global box office, making it the fifth highest-grossing movie ever made (having peaked in fourth position before Endgame knocked it down a place).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jurassic-world-2015>Jurassic World (2015)</h2><p>Pratt's third highest-grossing movie is another one that finds itself in the top ten list of the highest-grossing movies ever made (it's seventh, incidentally). This time, it's Jurassic World, which grossed a worldwide total of $1.670 billion.</p><p>The fourth instalment of <a href=#>the Jurassic Park franchise</a> has Pratt as its main star and sees the park having been open for business for years, with the new name "Jurassic World". Chaos inevitably ensues when a&nbsp;monstrous man-made hybrid&nbsp;dinosaur - the Indominus Rex - escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-2018>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)</h2><p>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the first movie on this list to not fall amongst the top ten highest-grossing of all time. It is, however, an impressive sixteenth in the list, having pulled in a very respectable $1.310 billion.</p><p>With Pratt once again serving as the movie's lead,&nbsp; the sequel to Jurassic World&nbsp;sees his character Owen Grady&nbsp;returning to Isla Nublar, along with Bryce Dallas Howard's returning character&nbsp;Claire Dearing, to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from an impending volcanic eruption.&nbsp;Meanwhile, a team of mercenaries plan to take&nbsp;the&nbsp;dinosaurs to the United States mainland.</p><h2 id=guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-2017>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We've now come to&nbsp;the point where the amounts grossed by the remaining movies place them outside the top fifty highest-grossing movies ever made - beginning with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which still managed to gross a hefty $863.8 million.</p><p>The movie sees Pratt as the leading character Star-Lord AKA Peter Quill and follows the titular team&nbsp;throughout the cosmos as they help Quill learn more about his mysterious parentage (his father turns out to be "Ego" - a nefarious Celestial being who's played by the wonderful Kurt Russell).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Chris Pratt's $15 Million Pacific Palisades Mansion</a></span></p><h2 id=guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014>Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The predecessor to the aforementioned Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Guardians of the Galaxy was actually something of a surprise success, given its characters' relatively unknown status in mainstream popular culture at the time of release. With Pratt as its leading man, it generated a worldwide gross of $772.8 million.</p><p>After explaining how he ended up in space in the first place, the movie sees Pratt's Peter Quill and a group of extra-terrestrial criminals going on the run after stealing a powerful artefact - the Orb AKA the Power Stone. They then go on to become the titular superhero team by saving the universe from the evil Ronan.</p><h2 id=the-lego-movie-2014>The Lego Movie (2014)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Lego Movie is a computer-animated comedy adventure with a fantastic voice cast, which Pratt heads as the leading man. He voices&nbsp;Emmet - a&nbsp;seemingly ordinary Lego minifigure who plays a key part&nbsp;in a resistance movement to&nbsp;prevent a tyrannical businessman from gluing everything in the Lego world into his vision of perfection.</p><p>The first movie in a franchise that now boasts four instalments (with more to come in the future), The Lego Movie proved incredibly popular with people of all ages (<a href=#>everyone loves Lego</a>, after all!) and it grossed an admirable $468.1 million at the global box office.</p><h2 id=wanted-2008>Wanted (2008)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of Pratt's earliest movie roles, Wanted saw him playing Barry - a relatively small part as the best friend and co-worker of James McAvoy's Wesley Gibson (the movie's main character), who also happens to be sleeping with Wesley's girlfriend behind his back. The movie grossed a not-too-shabby $342.5 million globally.</p><p>The movie sees Wesley - a frustrated account manager who discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin -&nbsp;deciding to join a secret society for which his father worked called the Fraternity.</p><h2 id=passengers-2016>Passengers (2016)</h2><p>Passengers is a sci-fi romance that starred Pratt in the leading role alongside the beautiful Jennifer Lawrence. Its worldwide gross was $303.1 million - which was actually rather disappointing, given its hefty budget and A-list cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie focuses on&nbsp;two passengers&nbsp;aboard <a href=#>a huge&nbsp;interstellar spacecraft</a>, which is carrying thousands of people to a colony&nbsp;sixty light years from Earth. The passengers in question - Pratt's Jim Preston and Lawrence's Aurora Lane - are awakened ninety years early from their induced hibernation and become love interests.</p><h2 id=the-lego-movie-2-the-second-part-2019>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019)</h2><p>The tenth and final&nbsp;entry in Pratt's ten highest-grossing movies to date is <a href=#>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</a> - the sequel to the aforementioned The Lego Movie. Pratt reprises his voice role as Emmet in this computer-animated adventure comedy that grossed $192.5 million around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking place five years after the events of the first movie, it sees Emmet and his girlfriend Lucy - voiced by Elizabeth Banks - and their friends&nbsp;heading into the Systar System to test their skills and creativity, while Emmet&nbsp;deals with an impending catastrophe&nbsp;referred to as "Armamageddon".</p><p>And that's it! Of course, this list will inevitably change this summer, following the release of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the aforementioned Jurassic World: Dominion</a> and Thor: Love and Thunder. However, for now, those are indeed Chris Pratt's ten highest-grossing movies.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Bill Murray Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><p><strong>Sources:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmoJmctaa%2F02aeq6ejqLavs4ycn6uho2K9s63TrWSmp6aesrR50ZqlpJ2UZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
