However, Johnny and Amber reached an agreement that will avoid taking the case forward. Amber a mere fraction of the $10 million she was originally ordered to pay.</p><p>The Aquaman star released a statement Monday morning explaining her decision to settle.</p><p>"<a href=#>It's important for me to say that I never chose this</a>," Amber said. "I defended my truth in doing so my life as I knew it was destroyed. The vilification I have faced on social media is an amplified version of the ways women are re-victimised when they come forward."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She compared the lawsuit to a previous case Johnny filed against The Sun after they published an article accusing him of domestic abuse.
