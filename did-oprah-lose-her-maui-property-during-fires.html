This disaster affected many homes, businesses, and lives. A significant number of the residents there have lived the majority of their life on the island. However, just as many love Maui and own vacation homes or residential property for part-time residency.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong></a> has never been hesitant <a href=#>to expand her property portfolio</a>. Because of that, she moved to buy 100 acres of property in 2003. The beautiful land came with a house that the star quickly renovated to become her own. Winfrey is one of many celebrities who call Maui their second home. But what became of her abode and the surrounding neighborhoods as the wildfires came through the area?</p><h2 id=oprah-owns-thousands-of-acres-on-maui>Oprah Owns Thousands Of Acres On Maui</h2><p>With <a href=#>an incredible level of wealth</a>, Oprah is free to purchase whatever her heart desires. Initially, the star purchased a 100-acre lot at the suggestion of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former fitness trainer and current property manager, Bob Greene</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the land came with a house, the original plan was presumably to renovate it to live in while building a new homestead.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Oprah Made The Ultimate Faux Pas When She Interviewed NFL Superstar Drew Brees In 2010</a></span></p><p>As luck would have it, after the process was completed, Oprah fell in love with the newly refurbished two-story home. She decided to continue living in it while staying on the Hawaiian island instead of building new.</p><p>In 2023, she added to her property portfolio, expanding the acreage number to 1,000. While she owns a large amount of land, she still doesn't come in as the top property owner on the island.</p><h3 id=where-is-oprah-39-s-house-on-maui>Where Is Oprah's House on Maui?</h3><p>While the exact location of Oprah's home on Maui isn't known, the star owns plots of land in three distinct island areas.

However, the celebrity doesn't only use this gated route for her own benefit.</p><p>Although <a href=#>Oprah decided against having children</a>, she has found many other ways to care for others, including using this particular road. Several years before the wildfires entered the area, a large brush fire started in a neighborhood close to Winfrey's home.</p><p>To help those affected by the tragedy evacuate as soon as possible, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winfrey quickly opened up her private road</a> so that those needing to flee could do so more efficiently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Local officials obtained the necessary code from Winfrey and her team and provided direction and assistance to those who needed to leave their homes.</p><h2 id=inside-oprah-39-s-6-6-million-maui-mansion>Inside Oprah's $6.6 Million Maui Mansion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Oprah4.jpg><p>When Oprah first saw the house that resided on her newly purchased Maui property in 2003, she immediately felt that the right path would be to fix it up to stay in temporarily while her dream Hawaiian homestead was developed elsewhere on the land.</p><p>While many people would perform the necessary repairs and call it acceptable, Oprah wanted the old farmhouse to have a complete renovation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Meghan Markle And Oprah Friends Or Using Each Other To Build Brands</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After hiring an architect and interior designer, Winfrey began seeing incredible changes. The master bedroom was moved to take advantage of the beautiful ocean view, ceilings were raised to provide the home with space for more oversized windows for taking in the gorgeous Maui landscape, and a large wraparound porch was added to enjoy the tranquility of the space.</p><p>Once everything was completed, Winfrey marveled at the transformation. While she had gone into the situation expecting to only stay for a short while, she immediately decided to forego those plans and remain in the original home.</p><p>While Maui has its fair share of celebrity homeowners who appreciate the privacy they receive when staying on the island, the destruction of the 2023 wildfires also <a href=#>impacted celebrities like Mick Fleetwood (and his restaurant)</a>.</p><p>Having over 1,000 acres on the island, Oprah Winfrey has a vested interest in the well-being of the area and its inhabitants, and has been seen helping distribute supplies to people on Maui.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdpL2zrcdmo6irlWK1pr6MppiuoV2lv7C8xKursmWUqr%2BqusZmnaKqlah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
