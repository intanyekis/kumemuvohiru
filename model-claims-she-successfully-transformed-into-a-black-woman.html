The 28-year-old ex-air hostess, who has size 32S boobs, used extreme tanning injections to achieve her radical new look, which she unveiled for the first time during a trip to Los Angeles.
Martina, who has to have bras custom-made to boost her cleavage, posed in front of the iconic Hollywood sign and said: “Last time I visited this with blonde hair and white skin – and now I’m a black woman with African hair."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They say, ‘oh, I like your style! Go darker! Go darker!’”</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/BVvsqNxA2En/?taken-by=martinabigofficial</a></p><p>She added: “Yes, I have the skin of an African girl. But I am not pretending to be a black girl.”</p><p>Martina has been charting her extreme makeover <a href=#>on Facebook</a>.</p><p>Last month, she commented: “Yesterday I was with an African hairdresser and got a hair extension with curly, African hair.</p><p>“To become more and more a black woman, that is such a wonderful feeling. I’m so happy.</p><p>“Next, I’ll have consultations for the butt enlargement and for the African facial features.”</p><p>Jabeer Butt, Deputy Chief Executive at the Race Equality Foundation, told The Sun Online: “It’s a very sad and disappointing situation really if people assume it’s just skin colour that makes you black.</p><p>“She has a very limited understanding of what it means to be black or an ethnic minority today, and the challenges faced.</p><p>“She has a very stilted understanding of what it means to be black – you have to worry about her and the people she surrounds herself with her.</p><p>“Her story distracts from the problems black people are truly facing today.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Many social media users agreed with Jabeer and were outraged at Martina’s transformation.</p><p>Alesia Roberts commented: “I’m offended. She gets praised for changing her skin color to look black. Meanwhile, little black girls are being teased because of their skin color.”</p><p>Seana Paige wrote: “This is despicable, disgusting and disrespectful!”</p><p>Another angry user said: “I’m not pleased or supporting this mess. I’m a black woman as you can see and I don’t think this is cool. It’s sad. It’s pitiful. I think she may have mental issues.”</p><p>“This is absolutely disgusting. I can’t believe people are supporting this. You do realize this is nothing more than blackface in the 2010’s? How are people so blinded by their ignorance to not correct this woman?” another furious user wrote.</p><p>“This is so offensive… I know some will see it as flattering that she wants to be us, but you look ridiculous. We don’t look like this. You have made us look like straight clowns. Being black is more than just a look. You have no idea what it’s like to walk in our foot steps. This is insulting,” commented another.</p><p>Martina has hit back at the criticism, saying she is following her “heart and feelings”, and compared her transformation to “black women who bleach their skin.”</p><p>Martina, who has spent $58,000 on plastic surgery since 2012, plans to get her bum as big as her breasts.</p><p>Surgeon Dr Karl Schuhmann from Dusseldorf offered his advice, saying: “Martina Big would like to enlarge her butt with [3 pounds] of implants each.</p><p>“From a medical point of view, I clearly cannot advocate the procedure. Alternatively, I recommended her a lipofilling [fat transplantation]. The risks are much lower.”</p><p>It has not been reported yet what Martina Big has decided to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7j3BmanFforylsctmmqWZmaLAbr%2FHnmSsrZOYsrS%2Fxa6jpbFdqb%2BiutKfpqullZl6qrrTqGSaZZKhrqS3jLCmppmeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
